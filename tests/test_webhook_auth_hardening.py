"""Regression coverage for the webhook-auth hardening pass.

Pre-fix critical bugs surfaced by the webhook audit:

1. ``slack_invoices.py:/events`` — accepted unsigned JSON, letting any
   attacker fan out to ``_handle_mention_reply_sync`` (writes ap_item
   timeline) and ``_handle_conversational_query`` (sends Slack
   messages on the org's bot token). The strict-profile allowlist
   in main.py was the only thing keeping this route 404'd in prod;
   defence-in-depth says fix the route too.

2. ``slack_invoices.py:/interactive`` — derived ``organization_id``
   from the AP item alone. An attacker whose Slack workspace was
   bound to org A could submit a click whose ``value`` JSON
   referenced org B's ``gmail_id`` and have the click execute
   against org B.

3. ``teams_invoices.py:/`` — read ``organization_id`` directly from
   the (untrusted) request body. Anyone holding a valid AAD bot
   token could approve invoices in any tenant by setting the body
   field.

These tests pin all three fixes via source-inspection: the buggy
patterns must NOT reappear, and the new auth/cross-check primitives
must remain. Source-inspection is robust against test-env quirks
(strict-profile filtering, full FastAPI lifecycle) that obscure
live HTTP tests of webhook routes.
