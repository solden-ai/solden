# Postgres test backend (C.1 of the SQLite→Postgres migration)

#
# Goal: run tests against the same engine that prod uses so the 44
# `if self.use_postgres: ...` branches are exercised in CI, not just in
# customer tenants. SQLite is kept as an opt-out escape hatch for devs
# iterating fast without Docker.
#
# Engine selection, in priority order:
#   1. TEST_DB_ENGINE=sqlite  → no-op (explicit opt-out for devs
#        without Docker / without a local Postgres). Tests revert
#        to the per-test temp-file SQLite pattern.
#   2. TEST_DB_ENGINE=postgres (default) + TEST_DATABASE_URL set → use
#        that URL. Useful for:
#          - Local dev with a running PG (e.g. `brew services start
#            postgresql@15`): `TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/clearledgr_test`
#          - CI pipelines with a service container provisioned separately
#   3. TEST_DB_ENGINE=postgres (default) + no URL → spin up a
#        testcontainer. Requires Docker daemon reachable.
#
# Default is Postgres. The full suite (2405 tests) passes on both
# engines as of 2026-04-22 — no known dialect divergence — so running
# against Postgres by default means any future dialect regression
# gets caught in CI rather than in production.

    monkeypatch-reverted pool depending on fixture teardown order,

    every pool-ownership question — same PG DB, new FD each call,
