"""Hard-purge behaviour for soft-deleted organizations.

The soft-delete tombstone (organizations.deleted_at) is meant to
trigger a real right-to-be-forgotten purge after a legal-hold
window. These tests lock in the three invariants that matter:

  1. The purge actually deletes rows from org-scoped tables.
  2. It never touches the append-only audit history (compliance).
  3. It never leaks across tenants — only the target org's rows go.

Data on other tenants surviving the sweep is the single most
important property here. If that ever broke, a scheduled purge
could wipe a live tenant's AP items.
