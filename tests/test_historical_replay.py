Historical Replay Testing — DESIGN_THESIS.md §7.7

"New model versions are run against this replay dataset. Their output
is compared to what the production model produced and what the AP
Manager confirmed. Disagreements between the new model and confirmed-
correct historical outcomes are reviewed manually before deployment."

This harness:
1. Loads correction history from the DB (what the AP Manager confirmed)
2. Re-runs extraction on the original input
3. Compares new output to confirmed-correct outcome
4. Reports disagreements for manual review
