"""Verify that ``exchange_code_for_tokens`` surfaces Google's actual
error reason (``invalid_grant``, ``redirect_uri_mismatch``,
``invalid_client``, etc.) instead of swallowing it inside
``raise_for_status()``. Without this contract, the diagnostic chain
during a sign-in failure is:

  Extension shows: "code_exchange_failed: 400 Bad Request"
  Backend logs:    "400 Bad Request for url 'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token'"
  Real cause:      ?

— which is exactly the loop we hit when an operator first tried to
sign in to the prod extension. The fix attaches Google's response
body (parsed when JSON, raw text otherwise) to the raised error and
the warning log, so the extension's red error banner from Phase 3.4
displays an actionable reason.
