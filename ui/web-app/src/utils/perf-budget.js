/**
 * Frontend performance budgets — DESIGN_THESIS.md §4.07.
 *
 * The thesis defines four pass/fail performance criteria for Solden's
 * Gmail surfaces:
 *
 *   Sidebar      — loads within 2 seconds of thread open
 *   Kanban       — first paint completes in under 1 second
 *   Home         — fully interactive before AP Manager reaches for mouse (~1s)
 *   Inbox labels — render before user finishes reading the subject line (~500ms)
 *
 * These are the budgets that govern whether a surface ships. Backend SLAs
 * are tracked separately in clearledgr/core/sla_tracker.py. This file owns
 * the frontend half — the budgets were drift before: the thesis called
 * them "pass/fail criteria" but nothing measured them in the bundle.
 *
 * Measurement strategy: each surface marks a start boundary when it begins
 * mounting or rendering, and a done boundary when it reaches its interactive
 * target. On done we log to console (warn on breach) and fire a
 * fire-and-forget POST to /api/ui/perf so breaches show up in backend
 * telemetry. The POST is best-effort — failing it never blocks the UI.
 *
 * Budgets are deliberately hard-coded. Knob turns are a product decision,
 * not a runtime-config decision — if we need to change what "fast enough"
 * means we should be doing it in a PR, not a settings toggle.
