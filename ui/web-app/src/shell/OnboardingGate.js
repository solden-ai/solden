/**
 * If the user's org hasn't completed onboarding, redirect into the
 * wizard at /onboarding from any other route. Skipped:
 *   - The wizard route itself (so it actually renders).
 *   - Configuration surfaces the wizard's "Set up" buttons deep-link
 *     into (/connections, /settings) — without these the deep-link
 *     bounces back to the wizard.
 *   - Admin/ops observation surfaces (/audit, /plan, /health). An
 *     admin owns the workspace and should be able to read the audit
 *     log, check billing, and look at integration health while still
 *     working through ERP setup. Forcing them back to the wizard for
 *     these is hostile to the very user who needs them most.
 *   - Public auth/legal pages (/signup/accept, /status, /privacy,
 *     /terms) so invite-accept flows + public deep links work pre-
 *     bootstrap.
 *
 * Coordination surfaces (/accounts-payable, /exceptions, /vendors,
 * /activity, /reports, /rules) stay reachable pre-onboarding — the workspace
 * owner needs to inspect their own data while the wizard is still
 * incomplete. Empty-state messages do the teaching when there's
 * no data yet.
 *
 * The gate is opt-in via bootstrap.onboarding.completed === false.
 * If bootstrap is unloaded or the field is missing, render through
 * (no redirect) — better to show something than to deadlock.
