        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <p>
          Solden collects only the data you explicitly connect:
          invoice content from Gmail or your ERP, vendor records,
          approval-routing metadata, and your team's identities and
          roles. We do not collect inbox contents beyond what your
          installed extension scope grants for invoice processing.
        </p>

        <h2>How we use it</h2>
        <p>
          Your data is used solely to provide AP coordination services
          to your organization. We do not sell, share, or use your
          data for advertising. Aggregated, de-identified statistics
          may inform product improvements.
        </p>

        <h2>Where it lives</h2>
        <p>
          Solden operates on Railway-managed infrastructure.
          Customer data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest
          (AES-256). Database backups are retained for 30 days and
          encrypted with the same keys.
        </p>

        <h2>Sub-processors</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Railway (managed hosting, US/EU regions)</li>
          <li>Google Cloud (Gmail API access where customer connects Gmail)</li>
          <li>Anthropic (Claude API for narrative summaries; deterministic AP routing does not call any LLM)</li>
          <li>Sentry (error tracking; PII-scrubbed)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          You can request export or deletion of your organization's
          data at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@soldenai.com">privacy@soldenai.com</a>.
          Requests are honored within 30 days per GDPR Article 17.

        <h2>Service</h2>
        <p>
          Solden provides an AP coordination layer for finance
          teams: invoice intake, validation, approval routing, ERP
          posting, and vendor management. Service is provided on a
          subscription basis with terms agreed in your order form.
        </p>

        <h2>Account & access</h2>
        <p>
          You're responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
          your credentials and for all activity under your account.
          Notify <a href="mailto:security@soldenai.com">security@soldenai.com</a>
          immediately if you suspect unauthorized access.
        </p>

        <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>
          You agree not to (a) reverse-engineer the service, (b) use
          it to process data you don't have legal rights to, (c)
          interfere with service availability for other customers.
        </p>

        <h2>Service levels</h2>
        <p>
          Production targets: 99.5% monthly availability. Status and
          incident history is published at the operations status page.
          Scheduled maintenance windows are announced 48h in advance.
        </p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>
          You may terminate at any time per your order form. We will
          provide a complete data export in CSV/JSON within 14 days
          of termination request. Data is permanently deleted 30 days
          after termination unless a legal hold applies.
        </p>

        <h2>Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, Solden's
          liability is limited to the fees paid in the 12 months
          preceding the claim. Solden does not assume liability
          for ERP-side or banking-side errors that result from
          actions you explicitly authorized.
        </p>

        <h2>Governing law</h2>
        <p>
          These terms are governed by English law. Disputes that
          cannot be resolved in good faith are subject to the
          exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
