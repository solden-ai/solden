# Solden Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 2026**

## Overview

Solden ("we", "our", or "us") is a Chrome extension that helps finance teams run AP workflows directly within Gmail. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data.

## Data We Collect

### Email Data (Processed Locally)
- **What**: Subject lines, sender addresses, and email content of emails you explicitly interact with
- **Why**: To detect and process AP-relevant documents (invoices, payment requests, and remittance-related context)
- **Where**: Processed in extension + backend runtime surfaces. Extracted finance fields and workflow metadata are sent to backend services for AP execution, policy checks, and auditability.

### Financial Data
- **What**: Transaction amounts, dates, vendor names, invoice numbers
- **Why**: To run AP workflow decisions, approvals, ERP posting, and exception handling
- **Where**: Stored securely on our servers, encrypted at rest and in transit

### Usage Data
- **What**: Feature usage, error logs, performance metrics
- **Why**: To improve the product and diagnose issues
- **Where**: Our analytics systems (no personally identifiable information)

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Full email content (only financial metadata)
- Passwords or authentication credentials
- Personal emails unrelated to finance
- Browsing history outside Gmail
- Data from other Google services

## How We Use Your Data

1. **Invoice/AP Processing**: Detect and extract invoice/AP request details from finance emails
2. **Approval Routing**: Send AP approval decisions to Slack/Teams surfaces
3. **ERP Posting**: Post approved invoices to ERP with idempotency controls
4. **Audit Trail**: Maintain compliance-ready logs of AP state transitions and external writes

## Data Security

- **Access**: Request a copy of your data
- **Correct**: Update inaccurate data
- **Delete**: Request deletion of your data
