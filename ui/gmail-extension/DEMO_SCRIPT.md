## Key Talking Points

1. **Embedded, not another platform** - Works inside Gmail, Sheets, Slack
2. **AI extraction with high confidence** - 96-99% accuracy on invoice data
3. **One-click approval** - Human in the loop, but minimal friction
4. **Automatic reconciliation** - 90%+ match rate on bank statements
5. **Conversational AI** - Vita takes action, not just answers

---

## Demo Tips

- **Pace yourself** - Don't rush through the UI interactions
- **Pause on results** - Let viewers see the extracted data and match rates
- **Show the transformation** - Before (pending) → After (processed)
- **Emphasize the "no new platform"** - This is a key differentiator

---

## Backup Flows

If something doesn't work as expected:

1. **Sidebar won't open:** Open `sidebar-demo.html` directly in browser
2. **Animations stuck:** Refresh the page, demo data resets
3. **Chat not responding:** The demo uses hardcoded responses, just click suggestions

---

## Recording Tips

1. Use a clean Gmail account or blur sensitive emails
2. Record at 1080p or higher
3. Use a quality microphone for voiceover
4. Consider adding subtle background music
5. Add captions for accessibility

- Deprecated demo assets were moved to [../../docs/legacy/gmail-extension-ui](../../docs/legacy/gmail-extension-ui) and are not shipped in the extension package.
