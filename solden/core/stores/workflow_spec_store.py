"""WorkflowSpecStore — tenant-authored, versioned declarative Box types.

Level 2: customers define Box types at runtime (no deploy). A spec is stored
per-tenant and versioned in the ``workflow_specs`` table; versions are
immutable once activated, and exactly one version per ``(org, box_type)`` is
active at a time. Importing this module installs two resolvers:

  * the WorkflowSpec resolver (``workflow_spec.set_spec_resolver``) — so the
    generic store resolves a tenant's active (or version-pinned) DB spec,
    falling back to code-registered built-ins;
  * the box_registry dynamic resolver — so per-type policy (e.g.
    ``exception_state``) is available for tenant types that aren't in the
    global registry.

Both are pure registrations at import; they are only *called* at runtime.
