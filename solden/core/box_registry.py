"""Box type registry.

The Box is the product — one persistent home per workflow instance.
This module makes that first-class in code: each workflow type
registers the shape its Boxes take so shared primitives (audit trail,
health observability, reconstructability checks) can dispatch by
``box_type`` instead of hardcoding AP.

As of the manifesto-truthing pass (2026-05-14) two BoxTypes are
registered: ``ap_item`` and ``bank_match``. The second proves the
architectural primitive generalizes — the manifesto's "the
architecture that runs AP runs procurement / compliance / vendor
onboarding" claim no longer rests on a single type.

bank_match is **AP-subordinate**: every bank_match Box carries a
``parent_ap_item_id`` FK back to its AP item. AP stays the
operator-facing record; bank_match is the typed sub-workflow for
the closing leg.

The ``vendor_onboarding_session`` registration was removed when
vendor onboarding was deprioritized per the AP-as-wedge product call
(see ``memory/project_vendor_onboarding_subordinate.md``). The
underlying state machine + table + service code remain in the repo
as option-value; this registry just no longer surfaces VO Boxes to
the runtime.

The registry is deliberately flat: a dict of :class:`BoxType`
dataclasses keyed by name. No inheritance. Box-level invariants
(atomicity, timeline append-only, Rule 1 pre-write,
reconstructability) live in the stores and execution/coordination
layer and consult the registry when they need per-type policy
(open states, exception states, source table).

    """Per-workflow-type Box shape.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name
        Canonical identifier written to ``audit_events.box_type`` and
        ``llm_call_log.box_type``. Stable contract; do not change without a
        migration.
    source_table
        The table whose rows are Boxes of this type.
    state_field
        Column on ``source_table`` that carries the current state.
    open_states
        States an active (non-terminal) Box can occupy. Used by
        ``get_box_health`` to compute time-in-stage buckets.
    terminal_states
        States that end a Box's lifecycle. Excluded from health views.
    exception_states
        Open states that indicate a stuck/blocked/exceptional Box.
        Bucketed as "exception clusters" in health output.
    stuck_thresholds
        Optional per-state minute thresholds beyond which a Box in that
        state is considered stuck. Falls back to a caller-provided
        default when absent.
    initial_state
        The state a freshly-created Box of this type enters. Lets the
        planner/coordination engine open a Box without hardcoding a
        per-type literal (e.g. AP's ``"received"``).
    exception_state
        The state a Box moves to when work stalls and a human is needed.
        ``None`` means this type has no stuck state (e.g. bank_match): the
        engine then raises a box_exception without moving state.
