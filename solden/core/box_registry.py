"""Box type registry.

The Box is the product — one persistent home per workflow instance.
This module makes that first-class in code: each workflow type
registers the shape its Boxes take so shared primitives (audit trail,
health observability, reconstructability checks) can dispatch by
``box_type`` instead of hardcoding AP.

Three BoxTypes are registered in code today, but only one is in the current
customer-facing product surface:

- ``ap_item`` — the production wedge; the operator-facing record.
- ``purchase_order`` — an AP-*peer* (stands alone, no parent FK). Kept as
  a post-AP expansion path behind feature gates, not shipped by default.
- ``bank_match`` — AP-*subordinate*: every Box carries a
  ``parent_ap_item_id`` back to its AP item; the typed sub-workflow for
  the closing leg, not an independent domain. Also gated off by default.

Tenant-declared ``WorkflowSpec`` types ride this same registry via the
dynamic resolver (see :func:`set_dynamic_resolver` / :func:`resolve`),
so the spine is domain-general by construction, not by special-casing.

The ``vendor_onboarding_session`` registration was removed when vendor
onboarding was deprioritized per the AP-as-wedge product call (see
``memory/project_vendor_onboarding_subordinate.md``). The manifesto
names vendor onboarding as a generalization target, so the underlying
state machine + table + service code stay in the repo as option-value;
this registry simply doesn't surface VO Boxes to the runtime today.

The registry is deliberately flat: a dict of :class:`BoxType`
dataclasses keyed by name. No inheritance. Box-level invariants
(atomicity, timeline append-only, Rule 1 pre-write,
reconstructability) live in the stores and execution/coordination
layer and consult the registry when they need per-type policy
(open states, exception states, source table).

class BoxType:
    """Per-workflow-type Box shape.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name
        Canonical identifier written to ``audit_events.box_type`` and
        ``llm_call_log.box_type``. Stable contract; do not change without a
        migration.
    source_table
        The table whose rows are Boxes of this type.
    state_field
        Column on ``source_table`` that carries the current state.
    open_states
        States an active (non-terminal) Box can occupy. Used by
        ``get_box_health`` to compute time-in-stage buckets.
    terminal_states
        States that end a Box's lifecycle. Excluded from health views.
    exception_states
        Open states that indicate a stuck/blocked/exceptional Box.
        Bucketed as "exception clusters" in health output.
    stuck_thresholds
        Optional per-state minute thresholds beyond which a Box in that
        state is considered stuck. Falls back to a caller-provided
        default when absent.
    initial_state
        The state a freshly-created Box of this type enters. Lets the
        planner/coordination engine open a Box without hardcoding a
        per-type literal (e.g. AP's ``"received"``).
    exception_state
        The state a Box moves to when work stalls and a human is needed.
        ``None`` means this type has no stuck state (e.g. bank_match): the
        engine then raises a box_exception without moving state.
    gated_actions
        Action names (engine planner vocabulary, e.g. ``"post_bill"``) that
        require the autonomy/deliberation gate before they may run
        autonomously for this Box type. Empty = no action is gated (the type
        has no risky autonomous writes). Declaring governance per type is what
        lets a second Box type plug into the gate instead of the engine
        hardcoding ``box_type == "ap_item"``.
    governance_skill_id
        The skill whose deliberation gate governs this type's gated actions
        (e.g. ``"ap_v1"`` for ap_item). ``None`` with a non-empty
        ``gated_actions`` means the type declares risky actions but no way to
        govern them yet — the engine fails closed (denies autonomous execution,
        requires human approval) rather than running them ungated.
