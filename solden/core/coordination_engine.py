"""Coordination Engine — Agent Design Specification §5.

Takes a Plan from the planning engine and coordinates its execution,
one Action at a time. "Coordinate" rather than "execute" because the
engine doesn't *just* run actions — it writes the timeline, handles
waits, routes approvals to humans, and sequences agent work with
external systems. Execution is one of the things it does; the product
is the coordination around each Box.

The Two Non-Negotiable Rules:
  Rule 1: Every action is recorded to the Box timeline BEFORE it executes.
  Rule 2: The coordination engine never assumes success. Every external
          call must return a confirmation before the Box stage advances.

Architectural note — what this is NOT (manifesto §"Coordination
through shared state, not orchestration")

The manifesto rejects the "master orchestrator / giant prompt /
workflow engine routing everything through a chokepoint" pattern.
``CoordinationEngine`` is **not** that pattern. To pre-empt the
naming-induced confusion:

  * No LLM in the loop. Plans are produced by a fully deterministic
    ``DeterministicPlanningEngine`` (clearledgr/core/planning_engine.py).
    There is no "giant prompt" deciding what action to take next.
  * No chokepoint over decisions. Routing, validation, approval gates,
    confidence thresholds, three-way match, and override policy all
    live in their own deterministic modules
    (``ap_decision.py``, ``planning_engine.py``, ``finance_agent_governance.py``).
    The CoordinationEngine just executes the plan those modules
    already decided on.
  * Shared state is the substrate. Plans read from and write to
    ``ap_items``, ``audit_events``, ``bank_match_boxes`` — the
    Box record is the source of truth. The engine is a pure consumer
    + producer of that state, not the holder of it.
  * Reversibility is structural. Every action goes through
    ``_pre_write`` (Rule 1) so a crashed execution leaves a Box in
    a recoverable state, not a wedged one. Override windows
    (``services/override_window.py``) and approval revert
    (``services/approval_revert.py``) close the reversibility loop.

What this module IS: a deterministic, audited, replay-safe dispatcher
that turns a typed Plan into the right sequence of side effects
(state transitions, ERP writes, Slack messages) while writing every
step to the append-only audit trail. The name ``CoordinationEngine``
predates the manifesto; ``ReactiveDispatcher`` would be more
descriptive but the rename's blast radius (100+ callsites, several
test fixtures, two surface tools) outweighs the cosmetic benefit. If
you're reading this looking for the "no orchestrator" promise —
this file IS the no-orchestrator implementation; the name is the
artifact, not the architecture.

        Closes the gap the Group 1 audit flagged: the synchronous
        skill path (``FinanceAgentLoopService.run_skill_request``)
        already runs ``build_deliberation`` before each skill, but
        the event-driven path (Celery → planner → engine) skipped
        governance entirely. Result: every webhook-triggered
        ``post_bill`` / ``schedule_payment`` / ``reverse_erp_post`` /
        ``freeze_vendor_payments`` was firing without the autonomy
        gate the deck and trust story claim.

        Why it's safe to be sync: the skill path also calls
        ``build_deliberation`` synchronously inside an async method.
        Under load this is a known event-loop blocker (Group 4 will
        wrap it with ``asyncio.to_thread``); for now we mirror the
        existing skill-path behavior for consistency.

        Fail-closed semantics: if governance evaluation raises, we
        propagate. Matches the skill path (which has no try/except
        around ``build_deliberation`` in ``observe()``). A broken
        gate stops the action from running, which is the right
