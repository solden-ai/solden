"""Multi-invoice intake — pre-split bridge between Gmail attachments
and the per-invoice triage path.

The single-pass processor is shaped around "one email, one invoice."
Two real-world cases break that shape:

  A) **One PDF with N invoices in it.** Vendors (especially in the EU)
     bulk-export a month of invoices into a single PDF and email the
     stack. ``solden/services/multi_invoice_splitter.py`` already
     detects boundaries and writes per-invoice sub-PDFs; this module
     calls it.

  B) **N separate PDF attachments in one email.** A vendor sends
     multiple invoices as multiple attachments. The single-pass
     processor caps visual attachments at ``MAX_VISUAL_ATTACHMENTS``
     (3) and silently truncates beyond that — without this bridge,
     invoice 4 disappears from the AP queue.

This module's job is to produce a flat list of "intake units" — one
per detected invoice — that the triage orchestrator can iterate over,
calling the existing single-pass + multi-call pipeline once per unit.

Each unit carries:

  - ``attachments``  — the visual attachments that belong to this
    invoice (typically one — either the whole original PDF, or one
    of the sub-PDFs from the splitter).
  - ``hint_invoice_number`` — when the splitter pre-detected an
    invoice number, surface it as a hint; ``None`` when single-pass
    should rely on its own extraction.
  - ``hint_total_text`` — same shape, the splitter's amount-text
    detection. Useful for amount sanity-checking downstream.

Failure modes:

  - PDF that doesn't parse / pdfplumber missing → return one unit
    containing the original attachment unchanged (matches the
    pre-bridge behaviour: single Box for the whole input).
  - Splitter returns one boundary → one unit, no fan-out — the
    common case for single-invoice PDFs.

Never raises.
