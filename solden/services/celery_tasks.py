    Group 6 (2026-05-07): the override reaper was historically

    ERP retry drain + queue-depth checks. That made operational
    debugging fuzzy: a Datadog alert on
    ``fire_pending_timers.duration`` could be triggered by any of
    five different reapers. Splitting the override reaper into its
    own task means:

      * Per-task metrics (duration, count, error rate) attribute
        cleanly to the override-window subsystem.
      * Tighter cadence (30s vs 60s) reduces max time-from-expiry-
        to-reap. Override windows are 15 minutes by default and
        can shrink to 15-min minimum on medium-confidence posts;
        a 30s sweep keeps the tail latency under a minute.
      * Failures isolate: if the reaper raises, only override
        reaping is affected — snooze, ERP retry, queue depth all
        continue on their own task.

    Runs alongside the FastAPI ``_override_window_reaper_loop`` for
    redundancy: if the FastAPI process dies, Celery beat still
    sweeps; if Celery beat dies, FastAPI still sweeps. Both call
