"""Pluggable bank account verifier — vendor-onboarding-spec §4.3 + §12.

The vendor-onboarding agent does not run payment rails. It orchestrates
one. Bank account verification is delegated to an open banking
provider (Adyen for EU customers anchored on Booking.com, TrueLayer
for UK + rest-of-world, Plaid for US when that market opens). The
provider returns a signed confirmation with the account holder name,
which we fuzzy-match against the KYC legal entity to disposition the
verification.

This module defines the abstract :class:`BankVerifier` interface the
planner calls. Concrete adapters live as sibling modules
(``bank_verifier_adyen.py``, ``bank_verifier_truelayer.py``, etc.) and
implement the provider-specific auth, link generation, webhook handling,
and signature verification. Today the only concrete implementation is
:class:`NotConfiguredBankVerifier` which short-circuits every call with
a ``provider_adapter_pending`` result — the rest of the pipeline runs
end-to-end against it while real adapters are being contracted and
integrated.

The contract is deliberately narrow. Three operations:

  check_coverage(country, bank_identifier?) -> (covered, provider, reason?)
      Tell the planner whether this bank account is in-scope for the
      configured provider. Out-of-scope vendors route to the manual
      bank-letter flow — see vendor-onboarding-spec §6.3.

  initiate_verification(box_id, vendor_email) -> (link_dispatched, provider_reference)
      Generate a verification session and return a link for the
      vendor to complete. The portal embeds the link in the
      bank-verify step.

  result(provider_reference) -> BankVerificationResult
      Fetch the verification result when the provider's webhook
      fires. Returns the account holder name, masked identifier, and
      a signed confirmation that the planner can use for audit.
