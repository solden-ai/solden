"""Pluggable KYC provider — vendor-onboarding-spec §4.2.

Solden does not run its own KYB/KYC pipeline. It integrates with
one. The KYC provider answers four questions about a vendor: does
this company exist in the local registry, is anyone on the beneficial
ownership chain sanctioned, is anyone politically exposed, is there
adverse media worth flagging. ComplyAdvantage, Sumsub, and Trulioo are
the candidate providers; which one a workspace uses is a configuration
decision (provider coverage varies meaningfully by jurisdiction).

This module defines the abstract :class:`KYCProvider` interface the
planner calls. Concrete adapters land as sibling modules and register
themselves via :func:`register_kyc_provider`. Today the only concrete
implementation is :class:`NotConfiguredKYCProvider` which short-
circuits every call with a neutral ``provider_adapter_pending`` result
— the rest of the pipeline runs end-to-end against it while the
provider contracts and sandbox integrations are being worked through.

The method set mirrors the four KYC tiers in
:mod:`solden.services.onboarding.kyc_policy`. Which methods the
planner calls for a given vendor is driven by the workspace's
configured tier:

  completeness
      No provider calls. Document completeness only.

  basic
      ``company_registry_lookup`` + ``sanctions_screen``.

  full
      Basic + ``pep_check`` + ``adverse_media_screen`` + ``resolve_ubo``.

Each method returns a :class:`KYCCheckResult` with a ``status``
(``clear`` / ``hit`` / ``inconclusive`` / ``provider_adapter_pending``
/ ``error``), provider-attested evidence the planner persists to the
audit trail, and the raw provider payload for review. Hits route to
the AP Manager via the standard escalation flow; inconclusive results
route to manual review.
