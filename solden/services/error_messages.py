Error State Messages — DESIGN_THESIS.md §18

"The principle governing all error states: the agent must tell the
finance team exactly what happened, exactly why it stopped, and
exactly what is needed to resolve it."

Each error produces a structured message with:
- WHAT happened (specific, names the entity)
- WHY the agent stopped
- WHAT to do next (actionable resolution)
