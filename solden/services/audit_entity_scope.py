"""Per-entity audit log scoping — Module 9 §300.

Resolves the entity scope for an authenticated user reading the
audit log. Returns ``None`` when the user has org-wide access (the
common case — admins and unrestricted users see every event in
their tenant); returns a list of entity_ids when the user is
restricted to a subset.

The list comes from two sources:

  1. ``user_entity_roles`` — per-(user, entity) role overrides from
     Module 6 Pass B. If the user has rows here AND no org-level
     admin role, those entities are their scope.
  2. ``users.entity_restrictions_json`` — invite-time restriction
     applied at signup. If the column is set on the user's row,
     those entities are added to the scope.

Org-level roles ``owner``, ``cfo``, and ``financial_controller`` are
treated as "see everything" — these are the people the auditing
contract assumes can read the full trail. Other roles fall back to
the entity-roles table; if that's empty too, the user has no
restrictions and sees the full org log.

The result is fed into audit-search SQL as a ``AND (entity_id IS
NULL OR entity_id IN (...))`` clause — enforced at query time, not
application time, per spec §307.
