# Solden AP v1 Execution TODO Backlog

## Summary
Canonical engineering backlog derived from `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/gaps_opportunities`, prioritized as `Now / Next / Later`, with mixed granularity:
- `Now`: detailed, implementable tasks.
- `Next`: detailed but shorter implementation criteria.
- `Later`: strategic epics with clear scope and ownership.

## Scope and Defaults
- Canonical backlog file: `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/TODO_BACKLOG.md`
- Strategic source remains: `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/gaps_opportunities`
- Priority model: `Now / Next / Later`
- Existing implemented foundations are tracked under `Deferred / Skip` and are not reopened as net-new TODOs.

## Release Buckets
- `v1-core`: required to ship AP v1.
- `v1.1`: important follow-on work immediately after v1 ship.
- `later`: strategic roadmap beyond near-term releases.

## Deferred / Skip (already implemented foundations)
1. Focus-first single-item workspace baseline
2. Invoice-centric worklist baseline
3. Linked source persistence baseline
4. Context endpoint and cache baseline
5. Browser-agent and agentic enhancements baseline (Point 7: scoped policy, preflight preview, retry/recovery, observability, API-first ERP fallback)

## Planned Public API / Interface / Type Changes
1. AP policy management APIs:
- `GET /api/ap/policies?organization_id=...`
- `PUT /api/ap/policies/{policy_name}`

2. Worklist contract extensions:
- `/extension/worklist` item adds `exception_code`, `exception_severity`, `budget_status`, `priority_score`

3. Context contract extensions:
- `/api/ap/items/{ap_item_id}/context` adds normalized `po_match`, `budget`, `risk_signals`, `freshness`

4. Ops KPI API additions:
- `GET /api/ops/ap-kpis?organization_id=...` with touchless/cycle/exception/on-time/missed-discount metrics

5. Merge control APIs:
- `POST /api/ap/items/{ap_item_id}/merge`
- `POST /api/ap/items/{ap_item_id}/split`

## Backlog Validation Scenarios
1. Mapping integrity: every open/partial item in Sections 8 and 9 maps to one backlog ID.
2. Deduplication: overlapping Gap/Opportunity/TODO statements map once only.
3. Priority consistency: foundational controls are all in `Now`.
4. Contract clarity: each API-changing TODO names endpoint and payload deltas.
5. Acceptance readiness: each `Now` TODO has a verifiable done condition.
6. Coverage: `Deferred / Skip` only contains already-implemented foundations.
7. Review UX: approver path receives budget/PO context without technical clutter.
8. Ops usage: tenant KPI payloads can power embedded digest delivery.
