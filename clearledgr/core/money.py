"""Money helpers — penny-exact Decimal arithmetic everywhere.

Project rule: every time a monetary value is summed, compared, or
arithmetic'd internally in Solden, it travels as `decimal.Decimal`
quantized to 2 decimal places. Float never touches internal math.

Why this module exists:

Float can't represent decimal fractions exactly. ``0.1 + 0.2 ==
0.30000000000000004`` in Python, which means summing 1,000 invoice
amounts stored as floats compounds a tiny error every add and drifts
the total by a full cent or two. For an AP aging report, a
reconciliation total, or a cross-invoice duplicate check, that's the
difference between "balanced" and "investigate why we're off by
$0.03". The fix isn't "round at the end" — the accumulation itself
is wrong. The fix is "use Decimal, which is exact for finite base-10
fractions".

JSON boundary policy:

Pydantic v2's default is to emit Decimal as a JSON string. Our UI
(Gmail extension) reads `amount` as a number and formats it for
display. Switching to string would break every `.toLocaleString()`
call in the extension. So the ``Money`` type defined here serializes
as a JSON number in `when_used="json"` mode — the Decimal is
``quantize``'d to 2dp first, then passed through ``float()`` for the
wire. That round-trip is safe because the Decimal is already clamped
to 2dp; all values representable in ≤15 significant digits (every
realistic invoice) round-trip exactly through float.

.model_dump(mode="python") still returns the Decimal, so downstream
Python consumers get exact values. Only the JSON encoder reverts to
float for wire compatibility.

Storage policy:

DB columns remain ``REAL`` (SQLite has no native DECIMAL, and
re-typing every column is a bigger migration than the bug warrants).
Reads go through ``row_to_decimal`` which wraps the stored float in
``Decimal(str(v)).quantize(Q2)`` — the ``str()`` step is important,
because ``Decimal(float_value)`` inherits the float's binary-rep
fuzz. Writes pass Decimal through ``float()`` at the last moment.
Authoritative sums (aging, reconciliation) are always recomputed in
Python Decimal after fetch; SQL ``SUM()`` is only used for display-
class widgets where a 0.01 drift is invisible.
