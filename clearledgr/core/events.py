"""Agent Event System — Agent Design Specification §2.

Formal event types and the AgentEvent data class. Every event that enters
the system has a type, a source, and a payload. The planning engine
dispatches on event type.

Adding a new event type means:
1. Add the enum value here
2. Add a handler in the planning engine
No other part of the system changes.
