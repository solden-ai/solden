"""Deterministic Planning Engine — Agent Design Specification §4.

Given an event and the current Box state, produces a Plan — an ordered
sequence of Actions. The planning engine is pure deterministic code.
No Claude calls. Claude is only called WITHIN specific Actions during
execution (classify_email, extract_invoice_fields, etc.), never during
planning itself.

"Rules decide. Claude describes."

Usage:

    engine = get_planning_engine()
    plan = engine.plan(event, box_state)
