"""V1 product-scope feature flags — DESIGN_THESIS.md §12.

The thesis draws two hard boundaries for V1:

  §12 #6 Outlook — "The answer in V1 is no. Solden does Gmail
    exceptionally. It does not do Outlook at all in V1. This boundary
    must be stated explicitly in every sales conversation."

  §6.8 Teams — "The finance team chooses their platform — Slack or
    Microsoft Teams." Taken in isolation this reads as "both
    supported in V1", but we've scoped Teams out of V1 intentionally.
    Slack is the V1 approval surface; Teams lights up post-launch
    alongside Outlook.

The codebase still carries the Outlook and Teams integrations — the
autopilot loops, the OAuth flows, the adapter cards, the webhook
routes. They were built for post-V1 and we don't want to throw them
away. But they cannot be accidentally live in a V1 deployment, and a
salesperson in a procurement conversation cannot be able to surface
them without a deliberate deployment-level flag flip.

This module is the single source of truth for those flags. Nowhere
else in the codebase should read ``os.environ`` for these — all
gating goes through ``is_outlook_enabled()`` / ``is_teams_enabled()``
so the behaviour is consistent across routes, autopilot loops,
bootstrap responses, and the strict-profile allowlist.

Both flags default to ``False`` to match the V1 boundary. Flip to
``true`` only when the corresponding surface is ready to ship.
