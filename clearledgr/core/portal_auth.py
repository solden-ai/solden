"""Portal magic-link auth dependency — Phase 3.1.b.

The vendor onboarding portal is the **only** part of Solden that
serves unauthenticated traffic. Vendors don't have user accounts with
the customer — they just hold a one-time URL emailed to them. This
module is the auth primitive that translates that URL's token segment
into a :class:`PortalSession` so downstream route handlers can act on
the right vendor onboarding session without ever seeing a JWT.

Design rules
============

* **Token in path, never in query string.** Query strings get logged
  by every reverse proxy and CDN on the planet. Path segments are
  treated as identifiers in most logging configs and are easier to
  scrub. The portal router expects ``/portal/onboard/{token}`` and the
  dependency reads ``token`` as a path parameter.

* **Lookup is constant-time hash compare.** Validation hashes the
  inbound token and looks up by hash via
  :meth:`OnboardingTokenStore.validate_onboarding_token`, which uses
  ``secrets.compare_digest`` defense-in-depth on the hash itself.
  Timing attacks against the auth surface should not be able to leak
  whether a token "almost matches" something real.

* **Three failure modes, three distinct status codes.** Production
  customer support uses these to triage:
    - **404** — token does not exist (typo, made-up URL, never issued)
    - **410** — token existed but is expired or revoked or its session
      has been terminated (the standard "DocuSign envelope already
      signed" error class)
    - **409** — session is in a terminal state but somehow still has
      a live token. Should be unreachable in practice; surfaces as a
      hard error for telemetry rather than failing silently.

* **Access tracking is non-fatal.** Every successful validation bumps
  ``last_accessed_at`` + ``access_count`` on the token row. If that
  write fails, the request still succeeds — instrumentation must not
  block the vendor's onboarding flow.

* **No JWT, no session cookie, no CSRF token.** The single-use,
  hash-keyed, short-TTL magic link IS the auth context. There is no
  session to fixate on, no cookie to steal, no CSRF surface that
  matters because the only thing the token grants is the ability to
  modify the specific vendor onboarding session it was issued for.
