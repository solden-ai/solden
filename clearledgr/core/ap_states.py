"""Canonical AP state machine as defined in PLAN.md Section 2.1.

All AP item state transitions MUST go through this module. No client or
service may force state transitions directly.

Primary path:
    received -> validated -> needs_approval -> approved -> ready_to_post
             -> posted_to_erp -> closed

Exception paths:
    validated -> needs_info
    needs_approval -> needs_info
    needs_approval -> rejected
    ready_to_post -> failed_post
    failed_post -> ready_to_post  (retry)
    needs_info -> validated       (resubmit)

Override-window reversal path (DESIGN_THESIS.md §8):
    posted_to_erp -> reversed (terminal)
        A human can reverse an autonomous ERP post within the override
        window (default 15 min). The reversal calls the Phase 1.3
        ERP-level reverse_bill API, which creates a cancelling document
        or soft-deletes the bill depending on the ERP. After a
        successful reversal the AP item lands in ``reversed`` and is
        then closed out. Reversal after the window has expired is NOT
        a state-machine action — the window is finalized and only an
        out-of-band intervention (e.g., a manual credit note) can
        undo it.
