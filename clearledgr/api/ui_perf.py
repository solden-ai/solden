"""Frontend performance telemetry — DESIGN_THESIS.md §4.07.

The thesis defines four pass/fail performance budgets for Solden's
Gmail surfaces (sidebar, Kanban, Home, inbox labels). Before this
endpoint existed, the budgets were words in the spec — nothing
measured them once code reached the bundle. This endpoint accepts the
per-surface timing beacons the extension fires from
``ui/gmail-extension/src/utils/perf-budget.js`` and stores them in the
existing ``ap_sla_metrics`` table under the ``ui.*`` namespace so the
backend SLA tooling already in :mod:`clearledgr.core.sla_tracker`
becomes the single source of truth for both halves of the
performance picture.

The endpoint is intentionally unauthenticated and rate-limit-tolerant:

  - The beacon payload contains no sensitive data (surface name +
    latency + optional org id hint). Requiring auth would block
    ``navigator.sendBeacon`` on page unload, which is the canonical
    transport for "report this metric as the user navigates away"
    telemetry.
  - Rate-limiting is applied upstream at the reverse proxy layer;
    the extension itself only fires on first-commit of each surface
    per session, so steady-state volume is at most a few beacons per
    user per navigation. A runaway client cannot pollute the table
    faster than the reverse-proxy rate limit allows.
