    Role (admin / owner / ap_clerk / etc.) controls WHAT the user can
    do within their org — NOT WHICH org they can access. Previously
    this function returned early for admin/owner, which meant an admin
    of Org A could pass organization_id=Org_B in a request and read/
    write Org B's data. That was a cross-tenant vulnerability active
    the moment we had 2+ tenants.

    There is no super-admin concept in the product. If one is ever
    needed (platform operator tooling), it belongs on a separate,
    internal-only route — not a role check on the tenant-facing API.

    Pre-fix this function coerced both sides to ``"default"`` before
    comparing — a session whose ``organization_id`` was the legacy
    ``"default"`` literal could bypass the check by passing an empty
    body org. We now require both values to be non-empty before
    comparing; missing org on either side is a 403.
