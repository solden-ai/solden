"""Box owner resolution — explicit, enforceable ownership.

The manifesto promises: "Who acts next. Not implicit through forwarding
rules and PTO calendars. When an attestor goes on leave, the workflow
knows. When a delegate picks up half, the workflow tracks the split.
Ownership is explicit, enforceable, auditable."

This module backs that promise. Given a Box (currently always an
``ap_item``), it answers two questions:

  1. Who *should* own this Box right now?
  2. If a delegation is active for that owner, who picks up the work?

The resolver is **pure**: it takes the Box, the org config, and a
delegation oracle, and returns an :class:`OwnerAssignment` with the
provenance trail (original → delegate, with reason). The caller
decides whether to persist the assignment — see
:func:`apply_resolved_owner` for the canonical write path.

The org's settings_json drives the state→default-owner mapping under
the ``routing_owners`` key::

    settings_json = {
        "routing_owners": {
            "needs_approval":         "controller@example.com",
            "needs_second_approval":  "cfo@example.com",
            "needs_info":             "ap-clerk@example.com",
            "failed_post":            "ap-lead@example.com",
        },
        ...
    }

A missing entry means "no default owner for this state" — the Box
stays unassigned and a human routes it manually.
