"""
Shared Inbox Model — DESIGN_THESIS.md §5.2

"When the agent creates an invoice Box from an incoming vendor email,
that email is automatically shared with all members of the AP team."

Implementation:
1. All AP items are already scoped to organization_id (team-level) —
   any team member with the extension sees all items in the pipeline.

2. When a finance email arrives in an INDIVIDUAL team member's inbox
   (not the shared ap@ address), the agent:
   a) Creates the AP item as usual (org-scoped, visible to all)
   b) Applies Solden labels to the email (visible in Gmail)
   c) Posts a timeline entry: "Invoice from [vendor] received in
      [person]'s inbox — added to AP Invoices pipeline."
   d) Sends a brief Slack notification to the AP channel so the team
      knows about the new item without checking the extension.

3. For the shared ap@ inbox, emails are naturally visible to all
   delegates. The agent applies labels and creates the AP item.

This module handles step (2) — the individual inbox sharing flow.
