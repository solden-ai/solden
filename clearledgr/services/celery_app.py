"""Celery Application — Agent Design Specification §11.2.1.

Celery worker fleet configuration. Workers are stateless Python processes
that pull events from Redis and process them through the planning engine.

Start a worker:
    celery -A clearledgr.services.celery_app worker -l info -c 4

Start the scheduler (Celery Beat):
    celery -A clearledgr.services.celery_app beat -l info
