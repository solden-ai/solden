"""Team-invite email composition + send.

Lives outside the FastAPI router so the body composition and
delivery-state shape stay testable without the workspace_shell
import chain (which pulls in psycopg via core.auth → core.database).

Used by /api/workspace/team/invites POST. The handler creates the
invite row first, computes the invite_link, then calls
:func:`send_team_invite_email` to fire the SMTP message. The
returned dict gets merged into the API response so the SPA can
toast accurately ("Invite sent" vs "Invite created — email isn't
configured, copy the link below").
