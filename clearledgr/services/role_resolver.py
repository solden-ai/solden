"""Per-(user, entity) role + permission resolver (Module 6 Pass B).

The dashboard's authorization model has two layers:
  1. **Org-level role** stored on the user row — authoritative when no
     entity is in scope.
  2. **Per-entity role** stored on ``user_entity_roles`` — overrides
     the org-level role for a specific legal entity.

This module is the single point that resolves "what can this user do
in this entity?" — backend gates and the frontend's permission probe
both call into ``resolve_role`` so the answer is consistent.

Reads happen on every approval gate; the (user_id, entity_id)
primary-key lookup is index-served. Resolver returns a
``ResolvedRole`` with the role token, the permission set, and the
optional approval ceiling — never raises so callers can safely
chain ``can_approve`` on the result.
