"""Invoice data model — the single intake-data shape used across every
intake channel (Gmail, Outlook, NetSuite, SAP, vendor portals, manual
upload). What started as the email-extraction record is now the
canonical contract every coordination call site reads from.

Channel-agnostic by design: the historic ``gmail_id`` is now treated
as a generic per-source idempotency key. For non-Gmail channels we
synthesize it from the source identifier (e.g.
``netsuite-bill:5135``, ``sap-bill:1010/5105600123/2026``) so the ~80
read sites that key off ``gmail_id`` continue to work without
touching them.

The handful of call sites that read ``gmail_id`` as an *actual Gmail
message resource id* (Gmail labels API, email-fetch, Gmail deeplinks)
guard on ``source_type == "gmail"`` or ``erp_native`` first. See
``state_observers.GmailLabelObserver`` and
``approval_card_builder._build_message_link`` for the reference
guard pattern.
