"""Approval revert — generalized reversibility within a bounded window.

Manifesto §"History" promises: "Every override. Every reversal. Every
retry. Reconstructable. Auditable. Reversible."

Until this module, the only reversal Solden actually supported was
the ERP-level ``posted_to_erp -> reversed`` path inside the override
window (see ``services/override_window.py``). This module extends
that pattern to a second class of reversal: an operator-initiated
revert of an approval that has not yet posted to the ERP.

Flow::

    NEEDS_APPROVAL --approve--> APPROVED  (now)
                                    |
                                    | (operator: "wait, undo")
                                    v
                              NEEDS_APPROVAL  (within window)

The window duration is governed by org settings; defaults to 15
minutes. Once the AP item enters ``POSTED_TO_ERP``, this path stops
being available — the ERP-level reversal pattern takes over.

Why this isn't routed through OverrideWindowService:

  * The ERP override-window service is tightly coupled to the
    external ``reverse_bill`` call. An approval revert has no
    external side effect — it's a pure in-Solden state change.
  * Coupling the two would require either dispatching by action_type
    inside attempt_reversal (which bloats a critical path) or
    factoring out a shared base. Both are reasonable but bigger
    refactors. This module reuses the *semantics* (time-bounded
    reversibility + audit + state machine) without entangling
    the ERP path.

A future commit can factor out the shared time-window logic into a
``BoundedReversal`` primitive that both services compose with. For
now, the duplication is small and the boundary is clear.
