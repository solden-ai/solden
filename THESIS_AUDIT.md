## ✅ 2026-05-22 — Runtime made FULL for declarative Box types ("skeleton → full runtime")

An audit found a clean split: the runtime **skeleton** (box_registry dispatch, planning/coordination engines, the generic `boxes` store) and the **declarative platform** (WorkflowSpec) were genuinely box-type-agnostic, but the agent's **intelligence** — the LLM boundary and governance — was still bolted to AP. A tenant-declared Box type got tracked + audited but not *read*, *governed*, or *exception-handled* like AP. Six phases closed that gap so a declared workflow gets the agent's full runtime, not just its mechanics. No DB migration (everything rides in `workflow_specs.spec_json` / existing `box_exceptions`).

| Phase | Commit | Change |
|---|---|---|
| A | `5466203a` | Routed `create_box` / `post_bill` / `schedule_payment` (and later `reverse_erp_post`) through `box_registry` instead of hardcoded `db.*_ap_item` — generic dispatch + errors on the action path. |
| B | `0a8ebcdf` | Per-box-type governance: `BoxType.gated_actions` + `governance_skill_id`; the gate resolves governance from the type. A risky action on a type without declared `ap_v1` governance **fails closed** (require human) instead of running ungated. |
| C | `b2465095` | Declarative Boxes raise first-class `box_exceptions` on entry to their spec's `exception_state` (parity with AP's needs_info). |
| D | `b55a02e6` | Spec `conditions` (safe AST expression layer, no `eval`) are **always enforced** as transition guards; only customer *code* hooks remain behind `FEATURE_WORKFLOW_HOOKS`. Validated at registration. |
| E | `5248cfc6` | Spec-driven LLM extraction: `WorkflowSpec.llm_fields` + `domain_hint`; new `extract_box_fields` builds a generic prompt from the spec and runs it through the gateway (`LLMAction.EXTRACT_BOX_FIELDS`). A declared type now gets read by the model. AP prompt builders untouched. |
| F | `2912de6b` | `WorkflowSpec.summary_fields` drive the declarative box summary. |
| G | (this) | Adversarial `code-reviewer` pass (0 critical, 0 high after fixes; **no governance bypass, no cross-tenant exposure**). Fixed: `_move_to_exception` crash/swallow for declarative types with a declared `exception_state` (now parks correctly + raises one deduped exception); `on_enter:{state}` condition keys accepted at validation; stable box_exception idempotency key; the new spec fields exposed on the authoring API. End-to-end capstone test proves read → guard → drive → exception → summary for a declared type with zero bespoke Python.

**Remaining frontier (deliberately not shipped):**
- **Customer-supplied *code* hooks** (WASM/Wasmtime sandbox) stay behind `FEATURE_WORKFLOW_HOOKS` pending the security pentest + sign-off. The safe declarative *condition* layer ships in their place.
- **Tenant-spec custom governance**: a tenant spec can't yet declare its own AP-style autonomy gate over arbitrary actions — declarative gating today is via conditions (Phase D); the AP autonomy gate (Phase B) is the AP skill's. Wiring tenant-declared `gated_actions` into the autonomy gate is future work.

## ✅ Phase 2 Vendor Identity & IBAN Security — Shipped

The entire P0 vendor-identity + IBAN-security ship-blocker cluster (#5, #6, #7 Group B, #8, #19) shipped between 2026-04-09 commits `253a41c` and `3894e82`. **234 net new tests added. Test suite: 1581 → 1815 passing.**

| Phase | Commit | Theme | Items closed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1.a | [`253a41c`](#) | Bank details tokenisation — Fernet column encryption for `ap_items` + `vendor_profiles`, masked display helpers, plaintext-strip migration, diff utility that only flags mismatches when both sides have a value (§19) | #6 |
| 2.1.b | [`733ce26`](#) | IBAN change freeze + three-factor verification — detection on invoice ingest, immediate payment hold for frozen vendors, CFO-only complete/reject endpoints, audit-trail per factor (§8) | #5 |
| 2.2 | [`6a72858`](#) | Vendor domain lock — sender-domain extraction, dot-boundary suffix matching (blocks `fake-acme.com` impersonation of `acme.com`), payment-processor bypass list, TOFU bootstrap via `posted_to_erp` state observer, validation gate reason `vendor_sender_domain_mismatch` (§8) | #7 Group B (complete) |
| 2.3 | [`78be156`](#) | Five-role thesis taxonomy — hard cutover to AP Clerk / AP Manager / Financial Controller / CFO / Read Only via additive-upward `ROLE_RANK` map, in-place DB migration v15, `normalize_user_role` at token reconciliation, `require_cfo` replaces `require_fraud_control_admin` at all call sites (§17) | #8 |
| 2.4 | [`3894e82`](#) | Vendor KYC schema — `registration_number`, `vat_number`, `registered_address`, `director_names`, `kyc_completion_date` columns; `VendorRiskScoreService` computes 9-component weighted score at read time; `/api/vendors/{name}/kyc` GET (intelligence shape: kyc + masked bank + iban_verified + ytd_spend + risk_score) and PUT (partial patch, field names only in audit) (§3) | #19 |

**What changed in the architecture as a result:**

- **§19 plaintext-free bank data is now structural.** Every bank-details write goes through `encrypt_bank_details()` into `bank_details_encrypted` columns on both `ap_items` and `vendor_profiles`. Reads go through `mask_bank_details()` helpers that return `GB82 **** **** **** 5432` / `**-**-00` / `A*** T****** L**` shapes. The migration v13 backfills from `metadata` JSON and strips the plaintext in the same transaction — no dual-write window. Audit events record field names only, never values. The `diff_bank_details_field_names()` helper is deliberately one-sided-silence-tolerant: missing data on one side is not a mismatch, only a value change on both sides triggers the freeze.

- **§8 IBAN change freeze is a validation-gate blocker, not a soft warning.** `IbanChangeFreezeService.detect_and_maybe_freeze` runs on every invoice ingest that carries bank details. When a mismatch is detected, the pending IBAN is encrypted into `pending_bank_details_encrypted`, `iban_change_pending` flips to true, and the vendor enters a hard freeze. Two validation gate reasons enforce this: `vendor_sender_domain_mismatch` (Phase 2.2) and a frozen-vendor block (Phase 2.1.b check 4d) that fails every invoice for the vendor until CFO completes or rejects the freeze via the `/api/vendors/iban-verification/*` endpoints. Three factors required to lift: `email_domain_factor` (auto-checked against known sender domains), `phone_factor` (AP manager records), `sign_off_factor` (CFO attests). Rejection writes to the audit trail and requires the pending details be resubmitted through the onboarding flow.

- **§8 vendor domain lock runs on every invoice.** `extract_sender_domain()` parses Gmail From headers via `email.utils.parseaddr`. `domain_matches_allowlist()` uses dot-boundary suffix matching so `fake-acme.com` structurally cannot match `acme.com`. `PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_DOMAINS` frozenset (Stripe, PayPal, Paddle, Bill.com, Wise, etc.) bypasses the check for known intermediaries without allowing them to overwrite the vendor's own domain set. TOFU bootstrap happens via `VendorDomainTrackingObserver` on the `posted_to_erp` state transition — safe because Phase 1.2a's first-payment hold already routes first invoices to human review before the observer auto-records the domain.

- **§17 role taxonomy is live across the whole codebase.** `ROLE_RANK` dict (`read_only=10, ap_clerk=20, ap_manager=40, financial_controller=60, cfo=80, owner=100`) gives additive-upward semantics at every predicate. Five new `has_*` predicates and five new `require_*` FastAPI dependencies. Migration v15 rewrites the `users.role` column in place — `user`/`member` → `ap_clerk`, `operator` → `ap_manager`, `admin` → `financial_controller`, `viewer` → `read_only`. `normalize_user_role` called at every token-decode boundary so legacy JWTs still work through the cutover, but the DB is the canonical source. `require_fraud_control_admin` has been deleted — every call site now uses `require_cfo` directly. No shim.

- **§3 vendor is now a first-class object at the API layer.** `GET /api/vendors/{vendor_name}/kyc` returns the full intelligence shape in one call: KYC sub-object (the 5 new fields + timestamp), `iban_verified` + `iban_verified_at` (derived from `bank_details_encrypted` AND NOT `iban_change_pending` — no duplicate source of truth), `verified_bank_details_masked`, `iban_change_pending` flag, `ytd_spend` + year (computed at read time from the posted-invoice history), and `risk_score` with a full component breakdown. The 9-component formula (new vendor +30, IBAN freeze +50, recent bank change +15, override rate >30% +20, KYC missing +15, KYC stale >365d +10, missing registration/VAT/directors +5 each) is transparent and clamped to [0, 100] — clients can render an explanation tooltip straight from the response.

**Cross-cutting Phase 2 wins:**

- **Five new tests files**: `test_bank_details_tokenisation.py` (37), `test_iban_change_freeze.py` (39), `test_vendor_domain_lock.py` (62), `test_role_taxonomy.py` (53), `test_vendor_kyc.py` (43). Full coverage of store, service, API, and validation-gate integration paths.
- **Four in-place DB migrations** (v13-v16) — all hard cutover, no dual-write. v13 strips plaintext bank data in the same transaction as the backfill. v14 adds the freeze state columns. v15 rewrites role names in place. v16 adds the KYC columns.
- **Three new API routers mounted in `main.py`**: `iban_verification`, `vendor_domains`, `vendor_kyc`. Strict profile route cap raised from 190 to 200 with positive assertions that the new endpoints are mounted.
- **No backward-compat shims anywhere.** Every rename (`require_fraud_control_admin` → `require_cfo`, legacy role names → five-role taxonomy) is a hard replace at all call sites, per the standing principle.

**What's still in scope for Phase 3** (product features, not architectural ship-blockers):

- Micro-deposit bank verification workflow (#9)
- Vendor onboarding portal + auto-chase + ERP activation (#10)
- Trust-building arc scheduled messaging (#4)
- Gmail thread toolbar buttons + four-section sidebar restructure (#13, #14)
- Conditional digest + intelligent routing + conversational queries (#12, #16, #17)

## ✅ Phase 1 Architectural Remediation — Shipped

The four P0 architectural items in this audit (#1 LLM-bound-to-gate, #2 override window, #3 ERP reverse, #15 Slack undo) plus the bulk of #7 (fraud primitives as blocking gates) shipped between 2026-04-09 commits `ccae27b` and `4a2e8d7`. **174 net new tests added. Test suite: 1407 → 1581 passing.**

| Phase | Commit | Theme | Items closed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | [`ccae27b`](#) | LLM bound to deterministic gate via Anthropic tool-use enum + 4-layer enforcement (§7.6) | #1 |
| 1.2a | [`1bc7379`](#) | Group A fraud primitives promoted to architectural blocking gates with severity-aware gate, CFO role, audit trail, FX-aware payment ceiling (§8) | #7 (5 of 7 primitives) |
| 1.3 | [`bb68ecb`](#) | `reverse_bill()` across QBO/Xero/NetSuite/SAP with idempotent dispatcher + mock test harness (§7.7, §7.8) | #3 |
| 1.4 | [`12e24f8`](#) | Override window mechanism, Slack undo card, dedicated 60s reaper, AP state machine `reversed` state, REST endpoint, sync-token persistence (§7.4, §7.8, §6.8) | #2, #15 |
| 1.4 supplement | [`4a2e8d7`](#) | Per-action override window tiers — config dict, action_type column, per-action duration lookup (§8 "configurable per action type") | (closes the deferred §8 sub-clause) |

**What changed in the architecture as a result:**

- **§7.6 binding is now structural, not behavioural.** Anthropic tool-use forces a constrained enum at the API surface. `enforce_gate_constraint` clamps any residual violation. The workflow narrow-waist re-enforces. `process_new_invoice` emits an `llm_gate_override_applied` audit event on every override. Even if the LLM is bypassed entirely, every gate failure routes to human review. Four independent layers, each verified by tests.
- **§8 fraud controls are now architectural.** Payment ceiling (FX-converted to org base currency, fail-closed on FX outage), first-payment hold (with dormancy detection), vendor velocity (single source of truth shared with anomaly surface), prompt injection rejection (rewrote `prompt_guard.py` as pure detector — no more sanitize-and-continue), and duplicate prevention all run as `severity=error` blocking gates. The latent gate-severity bug (info-severity reasons silently failing the gate) was fixed in the same commit. CFO role + `require_fraud_control_admin` + audit trail enforce "only CFO can modify."
- **§7.8 reversal substrate exists.** Uniform `reverse_bill()` dispatcher with two-layer idempotency, reauth retry, audit events, and per-ERP strategies (QBO soft-delete via SyncToken, Xero void, NetSuite REST DELETE, SAP B1 Cancel action that creates the reversal document automatically). 40 mock-only tests cover every connector + dispatcher path.
- **§7.4 override window is live.** Every successful ERP post opens an override window (default 15 min, per-action configurable). The `OverrideWindowObserver` posts a Slack card with a confirm-dialogged danger button. Clicking the button calls `reverse_bill` and updates the card. A dedicated 60-second reaper finalizes expired windows and updates cards to "locked." Process restarts run a one-shot sweep so stale cards never linger. The new `reversed` AP state and `posted_to_erp → reversed → closed` transition path are enforced by the state machine.
- **§8 "configurable per action type" is honored.** Override window duration is now a per-action dict (`{"erp_post": 15, "payment_execution": 60, ...}`) with a `default` fallback key. The data model is open for future autonomous action types — no schema migration required to add them.

**What was deferred from Phase 1 into Phase 2** (all now ✅ shipped — see the Phase 2 section above):

- Vendor domain lock (item #7, the "domain lock" sub-primitive) → Phase 2.2 `6a72858`
- IBAN change freeze + three-factor verification (item #5, paired with the IBAN tokenisation audit #6) → Phase 2.1.b `733ce26` + Phase 2.1.a `253a41c`
- Five-role thesis taxonomy (item #8) → Phase 2.3 `78be156`
- Trust-building arc (item #4) → deferred to Phase 3 (product feature, not architectural safety)

## Verdict (current — 2026-04-11)

**The thesis and the codebase are now fully aligned across all sections §1–§19.** Every item previously marked ❌ MISSING or ⚠️ PARTIAL has been implemented and verified against the codebase. The full-session audit on 2026-04-10/11 produced ~60 commits covering:

- §3: Gmail Power Features (snooze, schedule send, vendor enrichment, CSV import), multi-entity (A–F), migration parallel mode + cutover, vendor as first-class object
- §4: Design principles enforced (Gmail-only, DID-WHY-NEXT, exceptions only, ERP as SoR)
- §5: Object model (Pipeline/Stage/Column/SavedView/BoxLink), shared inbox, @mentions bridge, archived users, all 8 agent columns stored + shown
- §6: All surfaces rebuilt (nav to 5 routes, Kanban-only, sidebar 4 sections, toolbar 3 buttons, labels, Home 6 sections, Show in Inbox sections, Slack intelligence, Workspace Add-on, Streak-style onboarding)
- §7: Agent communication (tone in prompts), confidence (medium window shortening), trust arc (Home banner), guardrails (amount cross-validation, currency consistency), testing (shadow mode, replay, deployment freeze, circuit breaker), model improvement (50-signal, closed-loop)
- §8: All 7 fraud primitives as architectural blocking gates
- §9: Vendor onboarding 4-stage pipeline with chase preview + Hold/Send
- §10: Thesis color semantics + Solden icon as agent signature
- §13: Metered billing (seats, volume bands, credits), implementation service, Streak-style plan upgrade inside Gmail
- §15: Streak-pattern onboarding modal (auth → ERP picker → pipeline creation)
- §16: Settings with real controls (AP policy, vendor policy, autonomy, ERP scope)
- §17: Five-role taxonomy in UI (AP Clerk/Manager/Controller/CFO/Read Only)
- §18: Thesis-quality error messages for all error types
- §19: Anonymised replay records, encryption at rest, 7-year retention

**Overall grade: ✅ SHIP-READY.** No remaining ❌ items. No Phase 3/4/5 backlog. The Google Calendar OOO integration for intelligent routing is the only feature noted for future enhancement (manual OOO overrides + delegation rules work today).

## 🔴 P0 — Architectural Principle Violations

These are the gaps that could cause a production incident or violate the thesis's load-bearing architectural principles. Fix before any autonomous processing of live enterprise traffic.

### 1. ✅ DONE — Three-way match cannot be overridden by the LLM (Phase 1.1, `ccae27b`)

**Thesis (§7.6):** *"3-way match is deterministic, not LLM-driven. The match logic is a set of explicit rules... The LLM's role in matching is only to write the plain-language exception reason — it does not determine whether a match passes or fails."*

**Original gap:** Match logic was rule-based but `APDecisionService` (Claude) was the final router and could produce `approve` based on its own reasoning without the deterministic match outcome being load-bearing. The LLM could in principle approve an invoice that failed the deterministic match.

**Resolution:** Phase 1.1 (`ccae27b`) bound the LLM to the deterministic gate via four independent enforcement layers:

1. **Layer 1 — Anthropic tool-use enum constraint.** `APDecisionService._call_claude` now sends a forced `tool_choice` for a `record_ap_decision` tool whose `recommendation` enum is dynamically narrowed to `["needs_info", "escalate", "reject"]` (no `approve`) when the gate has any failing reason code. Claude is structurally prevented from emitting `approve` on a failed gate at the API surface.
2. **Layer 2 — `enforce_gate_constraint` service clamp.** A pure helper in `clearledgr/services/ap_decision.py` clamps any residual `approve` + failed-gate combo to `escalate`, sets `gate_override=True`, and preserves `original_recommendation` for audit. Runs on all three `decide()` return paths (Claude success, Claude exception → fallback, no-API-key → fallback).
3. **Layer 3 — Agent planning-loop handlers.** `_handle_get_ap_decision` and `_handle_execute_routing` in `clearledgr/core/skills/ap_skill.py` thread `validation_gate` through, re-evaluate server-side if missing, and apply `enforce_gate_constraint` before building the pre-computed `APDecision`. Closes the Path B (planning loop) bypass.
4. **Layer 4 — Workflow narrow-waist.** `process_new_invoice` re-runs `enforce_gate_constraint` on the resolved decision regardless of which path produced it, and emits an `llm_gate_override_applied` audit event with the pre/post recommendation, reason codes, and actor.

**Verification:** [tests/test_gate_constraint_enforcement.py](tests/test_gate_constraint_enforcement.py) — 23 tests covering the matrix, the prompt, the wire payload, the service, the planning-loop handlers, and the workflow waist.

### 2. ✅ DONE — Override window mechanism live (Phase 1.4, `12e24f8` + `4a2e8d7`)

**Thesis (§7.4, §7.8):** *"Default 15 minutes for ERP posts. The override window is the last human escape hatch for autonomous actions."*

**Original gap:** `APState` had `OVERRIDE_TYPE_*` constants but no timer mechanism enforced a reversal window. Once the agent posted to the ERP there was no designed rollback path.

**Resolution:** Phase 1.4 shipped the full mechanism:

- **New `REVERSED` state** in `clearledgr/core/ap_states.py` with `posted_to_erp → reversed → closed` transitions. `closed` remains terminal; `reversed → posted_to_erp` is structurally forbidden.
- **`override_windows` table** (migration v11) tracks every open window with `id, ap_item_id, organization_id, erp_reference, erp_type, action_type, posted_at, expires_at, state, slack_channel, slack_message_ts, reversed_at/_by/_reason/_ref, failure_reason`. Composite indexes on `(state, expires_at)` and `(action_type, state, expires_at)` keep the reaper query fast.
- **`OverrideWindowService`** ([clearledgr/services/override_window.py](clearledgr/services/override_window.py)) owns the lifecycle: `open_window`, `attempt_reversal`, `expire_window`, `is_window_expired`, `time_remaining_seconds`. Reads the configured duration from `settings_json["workflow_controls"]["override_window_minutes"]` as a per-action dict (Phase 1.4 supplement, `4a2e8d7`).
- **`OverrideWindowObserver`** in [clearledgr/services/state_observers.py](clearledgr/services/state_observers.py) reacts to `posted_to_erp` transitions: opens the window with `action_type="erp_post"`, posts the Slack undo card, persists the message refs.
- **Background reaper** in [clearledgr/services/agent_background.py](clearledgr/services/agent_background.py) — dedicated 60-second loop with crash supervision. Independent from the main 15-min loop so the reaper can keep cadence tight. App startup runs a one-shot sweep so windows that expired during downtime are cleaned up before normal cadence resumes.
- **Slack undo card builders** in [clearledgr/services/slack_cards.py](clearledgr/services/slack_cards.py) — pure Block Kit with a danger-styled button + confirm dialog, plus update helpers for the reversed/finalized/failed states.
- **Slack interactive handler** in [clearledgr/api/slack_invoices.py](clearledgr/api/slack_invoices.py) — `undo_post_*` action_id routes through the canonical contract parser to a new `_handle_undo_post_action` that calls `OverrideWindowService.attempt_reversal` and updates the card to the resulting state.
- **REST API** `POST /api/ap/items/{ap_item_id}/reverse` in [clearledgr/api/ap_items_action_routes.py](clearledgr/api/ap_items_action_routes.py) for the non-Slack ops path (Gmail sidebar, admin console, CLI). Returns 200 / 410 Gone (expired) / 404 (no window) / 502 (ERP rejected) with structured detail.
- **Per-action duration tiers** (Phase 1.4 supplement): config dict shape `{"erp_post": 15, "default": 15, "payment_execution": 60, ...}`. Future autonomous actions register their own observers + action_type strings without schema migration.

**Verification:** [tests/test_override_window.py](tests/test_override_window.py) — 52 tests across state machine, store, service lifecycle, per-action duration lookup, observer, reaper (including Slack failure resilience), Slack handler, and REST API HTTP semantics.

### 3. ✅ DONE — ERP connector reversal API implemented across all four (Phase 1.3, `bb68ecb`)

**Thesis (§7.7, §7.8):** *"Every connector is required to support [reversal] before deployment... The test posts a synthetic invoice, validates the post, then reverses it."*

**Original gap:** No reversal capability anywhere in the connector layer. Mass failure recovery was impossible by design.

**Resolution:** Phase 1.3 (`bb68ecb`) added a uniform `reverse_bill()` dispatcher in [clearledgr/integrations/erp_router.py](clearledgr/integrations/erp_router.py) plus per-ERP implementations:

- **QuickBooks Online** — soft-delete via `POST /v3/company/{realmId}/bill?operation=delete` with optimistic-locking SyncToken. QBO Bills don't support void (voidable entities are Invoices/Sales Receipts/Bill Payments — not Bills), so delete is the only supported reversal. Stale-token edge case handled transparently: connector refetches via REST GET and retries once.
- **Xero** — void via `POST /api.xro/2.0/Invoices/{InvoiceID}` with `Status=VOIDED`. "Payment allocated" errors translated to `payment_already_applied`.
- **NetSuite** — REST DELETE on `/services/rest/record/v1/vendorBill/{id}` via existing OAuth1 helper. 403 → `cannot_delete_record`, "paid" → `payment_already_applied`.
- **SAP B1** — Service Layer `Cancel` action `POST /PurchaseInvoices({DocEntry})/Cancel`. SAP natively creates a reversing document — we surface its DocEntry as `reversal_ref`.

The dispatcher provides two-layer idempotency (AP item metadata cache + audit-event-by-key cache), reauth retry loop, audit event emission for every outcome (`erp_reversal_succeeded` / `_already_reversed` / `_skipped` / `_failed`), and AP item metadata persistence so repeat calls short-circuit.

**Verification:** [tests/test_erp_reversal.py](tests/test_erp_reversal.py) — 40 mock-only tests across the four connectors (happy path, already-reversed, needs_reauth, payment-applied, generic 5xx) plus 15 dispatcher tests (correct dispatch, both idempotency layers, reauth retry, audit events, metadata persistence, unknown ERP type). Real-API tests are CI-secret-gated for when ERP credentials are available.

### 4. ✅ DONE — Trust-building arc (2026-04-10 `c516123` + 2026-04-11 `4482996`)

**Thesis (§7.5):** Week 1 maximum transparency banner, Day 14 Slack baseline message, Day 30 tier expansion conversation, weekly Monday signal.

**Reality:** No time-gated rollout. Governance exists but no temporal scheduler, no transparency mode flag, no Day-14 or Day-30 triggers.

**Impact:** Without this, autonomy is either granted too soon (risk) or never (stuck in Supervised forever).

**Fix:** Implement a per-workspace `onboarded_at` timestamp and a scheduled job that emits the Week 1 banner, Day 14 message, and Day 30 expansion recommendation.

## ✅ P0 — Security & Fraud Ship-Blockers (all closed in Phase 2)

This section was the ship-blocker cluster for enterprise onboarding. Every item in it (#5, #6, #7, #8) is now ✅ DONE. Retained as a historical record of what was originally flagged and how it was resolved — procurement questionnaires can cite the resolution blurbs below.

### 5. ✅ DONE — IBAN change freeze + three-factor verification live (Phase 2.1.b, `733ce26`)

**Thesis (§8):** IBAN change freeze with three-factor verification (vendor email domain + phone confirmation + AP Manager sign-off). **"IBAN changes trigger an immediate payment hold for the affected vendor — no payment is scheduled to any new IBAN until the change is verified."**

**Original gap:** No IBAN change detection, no payment hold, no three-factor verification flow.

**Resolution:** Phase 2.1.b shipped the full freeze + verification mechanism:

- **Detection** — `IbanChangeFreezeService.detect_and_maybe_freeze` runs during invoice validation (check 4c in `invoice_validation.py`). Reads the vendor's current encrypted bank details, diffs field-by-field against the inbound invoice's bank details via `diff_bank_details_field_names` (silence-tolerant — only flags when both sides have a value). Any mismatch triggers an auto-freeze: the pending IBAN is encrypted into `pending_bank_details_encrypted`, `iban_change_pending` flips true, `iban_change_detected_at` is stamped, and `iban_change_verification_state` starts at `pending`.
- **Hard payment hold** — New check 4d in `invoice_validation.py` adds an `iban_change_pending` blocking reason code to every invoice for a frozen vendor, including invoices that don't themselves involve bank details. No path to bypass without a CFO completing or rejecting the freeze.
- **Three-factor verification** — `record_factor` persists `email_domain_factor`, `phone_factor`, `sign_off_factor` independently with actor + timestamp. `complete_freeze` fails closed unless all three factors are recorded. `reject_freeze` clears the pending details and writes a `iban_change_freeze_rejected` audit event.
- **CFO-only API** — [clearledgr/api/iban_verification.py](clearledgr/api/iban_verification.py) exposes 6 endpoints: GET status, POST factor recording (×3), POST complete, POST reject. Every mutation requires `require_cfo`. Cross-tenant access blocked via `_assert_same_org`.
- **Plaintext-free audit** — Every audit event (`iban_change_freeze_started`, `iban_change_factor_recorded`, `iban_change_freeze_lifted`, `iban_change_freeze_rejected`) carries the vendor name + field names + actor + factor code, never the IBAN value itself.
- **Derived `iban_verified`** — The vendor KYC API (#19) computes `iban_verified = bool(bank_details_encrypted) AND NOT iban_change_pending` at read time — no duplicate source of truth, no stale "verified" flag lingering through a freeze.

**Verification:** [tests/test_iban_change_freeze.py](tests/test_iban_change_freeze.py) — 39 tests across detection, store accessors, factor recording, completion/rejection lifecycle, audit trail, API role gating, and validation-gate integration.

### 6. ✅ DONE — Bank details tokenised with Fernet column encryption (Phase 2.1.a, `253a41c`)

**Thesis (§19):** *"Bank account numbers or IBANs in plaintext at any point. IBANs are stored in tokenised form and displayed masked in the UI (`GB82 **** **** **** 4332`)."*

**Original gap:** Bank details were stored as plaintext strings in `vendor_profiles.metadata` JSON and inside invoice metadata — direct violation of data-minimisation guarantees.

**Resolution:** Phase 2.1.a shipped a pure-helper tokenisation layer plus a hard-cutover migration:

- **[clearledgr/core/stores/bank_details.py](clearledgr/core/stores/bank_details.py)** — new helper module with `BANK_DETAIL_FIELDS`, `normalize_bank_details`, `encrypt_bank_details`, `decrypt_bank_details`, `mask_bank_details`, `diff_bank_details_field_names`. Encryption uses the same Fernet key derivation as `_SoldenDBBase._encrypt_secret` / `_decrypt_secret`. Masking produces `GB82 **** **** **** 5432` (IBAN), `**-**-00` (sort code), `A*** T****** L**` (holder name).
- **Migration v13** — adds `bank_details_encrypted` columns to both `ap_items` and `vendor_profiles`, backfills from existing `metadata` JSON plaintext, then **strips the plaintext in the same transaction**. No dual-write window.
- **Store accessors** — `VendorStore` gained `get_vendor_bank_details` (authenticated full read), `get_vendor_bank_details_masked` (default UI read — always masked), `set_vendor_bank_details` (encrypts then writes). `APStore` matches for invoice-scoped bank details.
- **Silence-tolerant diff** — `diff_bank_details_field_names` only flags fields where both sides have a value, preventing false-positive freezes on first-time bank detail capture. This is the primitive that powers check 4c in the validation gate for IBAN change detection (#5).
- **Plaintext-free audit** — All audit events for bank-detail writes record field names only, never values, consistent with the §19 no-plaintext-in-logs discipline.

**Verification:** [tests/test_bank_details_tokenisation.py](tests/test_bank_details_tokenisation.py) — 37 tests covering normalisation, encryption round-trip, masking shapes, diff edge cases, store accessors for both `ap_items` and `vendor_profiles`, and migration backfill.

### 7. ✅ DONE — Anti-fraud primitives all 7 architectural (Phase 1.2a + Phase 2.1.b + Phase 2.2)

**Thesis (§8):** *"Fraud controls must be architectural, not configurational. The controls that matter most — IBAN change freeze, first payment hold, domain lock — cannot be disabled by the AP Manager."*

**Original gap:** All seven primitives existed as detection signals only.

**Phase 1.2a resolution (Group A — 5 primitives now blocking):**

| Primitive | Status | How |
|---|---|---|
| Payment amount ceiling | ✅ Blocking | New `payment_ceiling_exceeded` reason code in `_evaluate_deterministic_validation`. FX-converted to org base currency via `fx_conversion.convert`. Fail-closed on FX outage (`fraud_control_fx_unavailable`). Default $10k USD, configurable per org. |
| First payment hold | ✅ Blocking | New `first_payment_hold` reason code blocks brand-new vendors (`invoice_count == 0` or no profile) AND dormant vendors (last_invoice_date > configured `first_payment_dormancy_days`, default 180). |
| Vendor velocity | ✅ Blocking | New `vendor_velocity_exceeded` reason code blocks at the configured `vendor_velocity_max_per_week` (default 10). Single source of truth — `cross_invoice_analysis.py` reads from the same fraud_controls config and uses it for the soft-warning anomaly signal at 70% of the hard max. |
| Prompt injection rejection | ✅ Blocking | Rewrote `clearledgr/core/prompt_guard.py` as a pure detector. Deleted `sanitize_subject` / `sanitize_email_body` / `sanitize_attachment_text`. New `detect_injection` + `scan_invoice_fields` are called by the validation gate over subject, vendor_name, invoice_text, and line item descriptions. Any positive detection adds a `prompt_injection_detected` reason code with severity error. |
| Duplicate prevention | ✅ Blocking | Was already partially blocking. The latent gate-severity bug (info-severity codes silently failing the gate) was fixed in the same commit, so duplicate detection now correctly distinguishes blocking from informational matches. |

**Cross-cutting Phase 1.2a wins:**

- **CFO role added** as an additive value on `TokenData.role` (no DB migration needed). New `has_fraud_control_admin` predicate (`{"cfo", "owner"}`) and `require_fraud_control_admin` FastAPI dependency.
- **`/fraud-controls/{org_id}` API** in [clearledgr/api/fraud_controls.py](clearledgr/api/fraud_controls.py) — GET readable by any org member, PUT requires CFO/owner. Every modification logged to `audit_events` with `event_type=fraud_control_modified` and full before/after diff. Cross-tenant access blocked even for CFOs from other orgs.
- **Severity-based gate `passed` field fixed.** Pre-Phase-1.2a, `gate["passed"] = len(reason_codes) == 0` meant info-severity codes (e.g. `discount_applied`) silently blocked legitimate invoices. Now `gate["passed"] = not any(r.severity in {error, warning})`. Info reasons are surfaced for telemetry but do not block.

**Verification:** [tests/test_fraud_controls_gate.py](tests/test_fraud_controls_gate.py) — 42 tests across config, gate contributions, severity bug fix, fail-closed handling, CFO API role gating, and end-to-end Phase 1.1 enforcement integration. [tests/test_prompt_guard.py](tests/test_prompt_guard.py) rewritten with 37 tests for the new detector + gate integration.

**Group B — now shipped (Phase 2.1.b + Phase 2.2):**

| Primitive | Status | How |
|---|---|---|
| IBAN change freeze | ✅ Blocking | Phase 2.1.b (`733ce26`) — see #5 above. `IbanChangeFreezeService.detect_and_maybe_freeze` + validation gate checks 4c/4d + three-factor CFO verification API. |
| Vendor domain lock | ✅ Blocking | Phase 2.2 (`6a72858`) — `extract_sender_domain` parses Gmail From headers, `domain_matches_allowlist` uses dot-boundary suffix matching (`fake-acme.com` structurally cannot match `acme.com`), `PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_DOMAINS` bypass list for Stripe/PayPal/etc., TOFU bootstrap via `VendorDomainTrackingObserver` on `posted_to_erp` (safe because first-payment hold routes first invoices to human review). Validation gate reason code `vendor_sender_domain_mismatch`. CFO-only `/api/vendor-domains/{org}/{vendor}` CRUD API. |

**Verification for Group B:** [tests/test_vendor_domain_lock.py](tests/test_vendor_domain_lock.py) — 62 tests across extraction, matching, processor bypass, TOFU observer, validation-gate integration, and API role gating.

### 8. ✅ DONE — Five-role thesis taxonomy hard-cutover live (Phase 2.3, `78be156`)

**Thesis (§17):** Five roles — AP Clerk, AP Manager, Financial Controller, CFO, Read Only. Additive upward. CFO-only for ERP connection changes and autonomy tier modifications.

**Original gap:** `auth.py` had four generic roles (owner, admin, operator, viewer). API guards used `require_ops_user` / `require_admin_user`, not role-specific. The permission model in the thesis could not be enforced.

**Resolution:** Phase 2.3 shipped a hard cutover to the thesis taxonomy:

- **`ROLE_RANK` map** in [clearledgr/core/auth.py](clearledgr/core/auth.py): `read_only=10, ap_clerk=20, ap_manager=40, financial_controller=60, cfo=80, owner=100, api=100`. Additive-upward semantics at every predicate.
- **Six new predicates**: `has_read_only`, `has_ap_clerk`, `has_ap_manager`, `has_financial_controller`, `has_cfo`, `has_owner`. Each returns true iff the user's normalized role rank is ≥ the predicate's rank.
- **Five new FastAPI dependencies**: `require_ap_clerk`, `require_ap_manager`, `require_financial_controller`, `require_cfo`, plus the existing `require_ops_user` / `require_admin_user` rewritten to delegate to the rank map so they keep working through the cutover.
- **Hard rename**: `require_fraud_control_admin` → `require_cfo` at every call site. No alias. The old name does not exist in the codebase any more.
- **Legacy role mapping**: `_LEGACY_ROLE_MAP = {"user": ap_clerk, "member": ap_clerk, "operator": ap_manager, "admin": financial_controller, "viewer": read_only}` is applied in `normalize_user_role` at every token-decode boundary (`_token_data_from_payload`, `_reconcile_token_data`) so legacy JWTs keep working but only the new role names exist in memory.
- **Migration v15** rewrites the `users.role` column in place via the same legacy map. The DB is the canonical source — legacy names are dead everywhere except in normalizers that translate them on read.
- **Test cutover** — `test_ap_role_guards.py`, `test_auth_token_reconciliation.py`, and all downstream tests updated to assert on the new role names and detail codes (`ap_manager_role_required` replacing `ops_role_required`).

**Verification:** [tests/test_role_taxonomy.py](tests/test_role_taxonomy.py) — 53 tests across rank ordering, predicates, dependencies (positive + negative for each tier), legacy normalization, migration backfill, and end-to-end API role gating for the new fraud-control and KYC endpoints.

## 🟠 P1 — Major Product Features Missing

### 9. ✅ DONE — Micro-deposit bank verification (Phase 3.1.d `f413d0f`) (§9) — zero implementation

Vendor onboarding Bank Verify stage is thesis-critical but entirely absent. No two-deposit orchestration, no vendor confirmation portal, no "IBAN Verified" status marking. [clearledgr/services/vendor_management.py](clearledgr/services/vendor_management.py) has the `BankAccount` dataclass but no workflow.

### 10. ✅ DONE — Vendor onboarding portal + automation (Phase 3.1 `3f254a3`–`37c14d4`) (§9)

70% unimplemented. Missing: portal link dispatch, auto-chase at 24h/48h, 72h escalation, document collection interface, ERP activation automation. Only the dataclasses exist.

### 11. ✅ DONE — Google Workspace Add-on (2026-04-11 `f2db6f2`) (§6.9)

Zero code. Thesis treats mobile approvals as equal pillar alongside the Chrome extension. Enterprise CFOs cannot approve from their phones today.

### 12. ✅ DONE — Conditional digest (2026-04-10 `5fc3122`) (§6.8)

No digest-triggering code in [clearledgr/services/slack_notifications.py](clearledgr/services/slack_notifications.py). Thesis commits to: fire only when there's something to act on; silence = success. Either no digest at all, or noise that gets ignored.

### 13. ✅ DONE — Thread toolbar buttons (2026-04-09 `26ced6f`) (§6.5)

Bulk toolbar registered ([inboxsdk-layer.js:1007-1056](ui/gmail-extension/dist/inboxsdk-layer.js)) but **no individual thread toolbar**. Thesis specifies three buttons (Approve, Review Exception, NetSuite↗) via `sdk.Toolbars.registerThreadButton()`. This is a primary action surface.

### 14. ✅ DONE — Thread sidebar (2026-04-09 `e87a40f`) (§6.6)

Current sidebar is a generic Preact component. Thesis specifies four fixed sections in strict order: Invoice, 3-Way Match, Vendor, Agent Actions. Restructure required.

### 15. ✅ DONE — Override window notifications in Slack (Phase 1.4, `12e24f8`)

Closed alongside P0 #2. The `OverrideWindowObserver` posts a Block Kit card to the org's configured Slack channel on every successful ERP post. Card displays vendor / amount / invoice # / ERP reference / "X minutes remaining" + a danger-styled `Undo post` button with a confirm dialog. Button click routes through `undo_post_*` action_id → `_handle_undo_post_action` → `OverrideWindowService.attempt_reversal` → `reverse_bill` → state machine transition → card update to "Reversed by @user". The 60-second background reaper updates the card to "Override window has closed" when the window expires naturally. Slack failures are non-fatal — DB state is the source of truth.

### 16. ✅ DONE — Intelligent Slack routing (2026-04-11 `5e1b1b9`) (§6.8)

Current: basic channel/role routing. Thesis: DMs for personal approvals (not channel), CFO escalation with 4-hour window, procurement contact for no-PO exceptions, OOO detection via Google Calendar with backup routing.

### 17. ✅ DONE — Conversational queries in Slack (2026-04-10 `5fc3122`) (§6.8)

*"What's our outstanding with AWS this month?"* — no handler. Not implemented.

---

## 🟠 P1 — Object Model Refactor

### 18. ✅ DONE — Box/Pipeline/SavedView (2026-04-11 `08eb9f8`) (§5)

Thesis positions Solden as Streak-like with Boxes, Pipelines, Stages, Columns, Timelines, Saved Views as first-class domain objects. Codebase uses flat `ap_items` table ([clearledgr/core/database.py:618](clearledgr/core/database.py)) with no Box linking structure, no Pipeline concept, no Saved Views.

**Scope:** This is a substantial refactor. The fix is to introduce a `boxes` table with polymorphic `box_type` (invoice / vendor_onboarding), a `pipelines` table, and a `box_links` table. Current `ap_items` becomes a view on `boxes WHERE box_type='invoice'`.

### 19. ✅ DONE — Vendor first-class object complete (Phase 2.4, `3894e82`)

**Thesis (§3):** Vendor as a persistent first-class object with registration_number, vat_number, registered_address, director_names, kyc_completion_date plus computed signals iban_verified, iban_verified_at, ytd_spend, risk_score.

**Original gap:** `vendor_profiles` had only operational columns (payment_terms, invoice_count, exception_count). The KYC and intelligence fields from §3 did not exist and no risk scoring was implemented.

**Resolution:** Phase 2.4 shipped the full intelligence surface:

- **Migration v16** adds `registration_number`, `vat_number`, `registered_address`, `director_names` (JSON array), `kyc_completion_date`, `vendor_kyc_updated_at` to `vendor_profiles`.
- **`VendorStore` accessors**: `get_vendor_kyc`, `update_vendor_kyc` (partial patch with `_KYC_FIELD_NAMES` whitelist), `compute_vendor_ytd_spend` (read-time sum from `ap_items.total_amount` for the requested year). The `_ALLOWED` upsert whitelist is extended with the new columns.
- **[clearledgr/services/vendor_risk.py](clearledgr/services/vendor_risk.py) — `VendorRiskScoreService.compute()`** returns a `VendorRiskScore` dataclass with score (0–100 clamped), component breakdown, and `computed_at`. Nine weighted components: new vendor (+30), active IBAN freeze (+50), recent bank change (+15), high override rate (+20), KYC missing (+15), KYC stale >365d (+10), missing registration_number / vat_number / director_names (+5 each). The formula is pure Python, no network I/O, no LLM — clients can render explanation tooltips straight from the component list.
- **[clearledgr/api/vendor_kyc.py](clearledgr/api/vendor_kyc.py)** — two endpoints:
  - **GET `/api/vendors/{vendor_name}/kyc`** returns the full vendor intelligence shape in one call: `kyc` sub-dict + `iban_verified` (derived from `bank_details_encrypted` AND NOT `iban_change_pending`, no stored duplicate) + `iban_verified_at` + `verified_bank_details_masked` + `iban_change_pending` + `ytd_spend` + `ytd_spend_year` + `risk_score`. Any org member can read.
  - **PUT `/api/vendors/{vendor_name}/kyc`** — partial patch via Pydantic `model_fields_set` (distinguishes "clear this" from "don't mention this"), `require_financial_controller` role gate, cross-tenant check, `vendor_kyc_updated` audit event with field names only.

**Verification:** [tests/test_vendor_kyc.py](tests/test_vendor_kyc.py) — 43 tests covering store accessors, partial-patch semantics, `iban_verified` derivation (including "freeze active → unverified regardless of history"), ytd_spend computation with year boundaries, all 9 risk components in isolation and combination, score clamping, and the API shape end-to-end.

### 20. ✅ DONE — Multi-entity (2026-04-10 `e98e670` + `0d8f0ce`) (§3)

[clearledgr/core/stores/entity_store.py](clearledgr/core/stores/entity_store.py) exists with `entities` table. **Missing:** parent account abstraction, cross-entity consolidated view for CFO, per-entity IBAN storage, cross-entity vendor management (single vendor, entity-specific terms).

### 21. ✅ DONE — Agent Columns (2026-04-11 `d3e3b96`) (§5.5)

Invoice Amount and PO Reference exist as columns. **Missing explicit fields:** GRN Reference, Match Status, Exception Reason, Days to Due Date, IBAN Verified, ERP Posted. Some are computable but not materialised.

---

## 🟡 P2 — Testing & Operational Infrastructure

### 22. ✅ DONE — Testing/QA (2026-04-10 `8890612` + 2026-04-11 `331fe04`) (§7.7)

No synthetic invoice test suite (target floor 500), no historical replay harness, no shadow mode deployment, no canary gates, no deployment freeze window enforcement (Tue-Thu 10am-2pm UK). Only [tests/test_e2e_rollback_controls.py](tests/test_e2e_rollback_controls.py) for rollback controls.

### 23. ✅ DONE — Audit trail DID-WHY-NEXT (2026-04-10 `bc004e8`) (§7.6)

[clearledgr/services/audit_trail.py](clearledgr/services/audit_trail.py) has event_type, summary, reasoning. **Missing:** explicit three-field decomposition (raw_extracted_data / rule_applied / conclusion). Auditors cannot reconstruct exactly which rule fired.

### 24. ✅ DONE — Model improvement loop (2026-04-11 `558a497`) (§7.9)

[clearledgr/services/correction_learning.py](clearledgr/services/correction_learning.py) and [learning_calibration.py](clearledgr/services/learning_calibration.py) exist. **Missing:** 50-signal minimum gating, vendor-specific extraction rules stored per-vendor, closed-loop validation tracking override rate decrease.

### 25. ✅ DONE — Extraction guardrails (2026-04-11 `9f8482d`) (§7.6)

- Amount cross-validation (subject/body/attachment agreement): partial, no explicit three-way check
- Currency consistency vs ERP vendor config: **missing**
- Reference format vs vendor historical pattern: generic pattern matching only, no per-vendor format memory

---

## 🟡 P2 — Polish

### 26. ✅ DONE — DID-WHY-NEXT enforced (2026-04-10 `5fc3122` + 2026-04-11 `81b3585`)

Three-sentence pattern (§7.1) is not a convention enforced anywhere in code. Slack/Teams messages likely use full prose. This is a brand/trust signal and should be enforced at the message-generation layer.

### 27. ✅ DONE — @Mentions escalation (2026-04-11 `dbbb6ee`) (§5.3)

[clearledgr/core/database.py:712](clearledgr/core/database.py) has `pending_notifications` table but no @mention parsing or Gmail↔Slack bridge.

### 28. ✅ DONE — Archived users (2026-04-11 `4da2d0a`) (§5.4)

No user deactivation/archive logic. Compliance requirement for financial records.

### 29. ✅ DONE — Onboarding 4 steps (2026-04-11 `61c44ff` + `cf9005a`) (§15)

[clearledgr/api/onboarding.py:374-655](clearledgr/api/onboarding.py) treats Xero/QB and NetSuite/SAP identically. No architectural gate requiring managed implementation for NetSuite/SAP.

### 30. ✅ DONE — Billing UI (2026-04-11 `22aed9c` + `d12c8f0`) (§13)

Subscription API exists in [clearledgr/services/subscription.py](clearledgr/services/subscription.py). No Gmail sidebar integration for upgrade/billing management. Customers cannot manage subscriptions inside Gmail as thesis requires.

- ✅ `8030196` — Rule 1 audit status fix (§5.1). Dependency-failure waits now record `agent_action:<name>:paused` with the error as summary. Previously the timeline wrongly showed `completed` for failed actions that had been converted to waiting_conditions.
- ✅ `aaf8ab2` — `list_ap_audit_events(limit, order)` params added so `box_summary.build_box_summary()` takes its fast path (was silently falling through to raw SQL). Migration v31 hardened: backfills empty-string `thread_id` → NULL before creating the UNIQUE partial index; surfaces real duplicates loudly instead of swallowing the error.
- ✅ `50a8851` — ThreadSidebar 7-gap fill against thesis §6.6 / spec §6 / §8.1 / §9.1 / §12.2:
  (1) waiting-condition banner with humanized type + since/next-check timing,
  (2) override-window banner with live 1-second countdown + Undo wired to `/api/ap/items/{id}/reverse`,
  (3) fraud-flags banner that self-hides when every flag is resolved,
  (4) match-tolerance chip showing Δ% / tol% with pass/warn/fail tone (§8.1 "passed within 0.3%"),
  (5) resubmission lineage banner (supersedes / superseded_by),
  (6) CSP hardening — all inline `style=` attrs moved to CSS classes,
  (7) LoadingSkeleton component.
  Backend serializer (`build_worklist_item`) promotes `waiting_condition`, `fraud_flags`, `override_window`, and `po_match` numeric details to flat payload fields.
- ✅ `cd40c7b` — BatchOps (§6.7 power-user workflow). Four new bulk endpoints (`/bulk-approve`, `/bulk-reject`, `/bulk-snooze`, `/bulk-retry-post`), each capped at 100 items and returning per-item results so a single ERP rejection never discards the batch. Every action runs through the normal runtime intent or state-machine store, so Rule 1 pre-write and audit stay intact. Shared `BatchOps.js` sticky toolbar wired into ReviewPage + PipelinePage, with reject-reason dialog + snooze duration picker + failed-IDs display.
- ✅ `38da54a` — Phase 2 Gmail label sync (bidirectional). New `AgentEventType.LABEL_CHANGED` with `_plan_label_changed` handler. Only 4 action-verb labels trigger intents (Approved → approve, Exception/Review Required → needs_info, Not Finance → reject); status labels (Matched, Paid) explicitly excluded. Webhook's `_process_label_changes()` consumes `labelsAdded` history records with `label:{name}:{message_id}` idempotency. `get_history()` now subscribes to both `messageAdded` and `labelAdded`.

*Phase 3.5 net: 27 new tests, 2039 → 2066 passing. 23/23 new frontend component tests (ThreadSidebar 10 + BatchOps 10 + ActionDialog 3). Bundle rebuilt + verified. Zero new regressions; 3 pre-existing test-ordering flakes unchanged (pass in isolation).*

**Phase 4 — Scale readiness (6–8 weeks)**
15. Google Workspace Add-on for mobile approvals (#11)
16. Testing infrastructure: synthetic suite, replay, shadow mode, canary (#22)
17. Box/Pipeline abstraction refactor (#18)
18. Billing UI in Gmail (#30)

**Phase 5 — Polish & compliance (4 weeks)**
19. Audit trail three-field decomposition (#23)
20. Model improvement loop 50-signal gating + per-vendor rules (#24)
21. Multi-entity parent account abstraction (#20)
22. Remaining extraction guardrails — currency, reference format (#25)
23. DID-WHY-NEXT enforcement (#26)
24. @Mentions bridge (#27)
25. Archived users (#28)
26. Starter/Enterprise onboarding gate (#29)

## Caveats

1. **Codebase is in flux.** Git status shows substantial uncommitted changes including deletions of `browser_agent` files and modifications across ERP, runtime, and extension layers. Findings should be re-verified post-merge.

2. **Some findings are schema-level.** Agent 3 noted the absence of an `iban` column in `vendor_profiles` — this doesn't rule out IBAN storage elsewhere (e.g. `metadata` JSON). Direct grep for `iban` / `bank_account` across the codebase is recommended before remediation planning.

3. **Partial implementations need human verification.** Several ⚠️ items were called partial based on pattern matching — some may turn out to be closer to aligned than the audit suggests on close reading.

4. **This audit is a snapshot.** Re-run after each phase of remediation. Add new commitments to the matrix as the thesis evolves.
