## What Solden Is

Solden is an agentic AI execution layer for finance teams. It is not a rule-based automation tool. The system observes invoice context, reasons about what action to take, executes across Gmail, Slack, and ERP, and learns from every human correction.

The first production skill runs accounts payable from Gmail: triage invoices, route approvals, validate against ERP, and write approved invoices back without manual approval chasing or duplicate data entry.

**Agentic, not just automated:**
- A deterministic validation layer (PO matching, duplicate detection, policy checks) acts as the guardrail
- An AI reasoning layer (Claude Sonnet with full vendor context) makes judgment calls above the guardrail
- The agent decides: approve, escalate, request info, or reject — with reasoning and risk flags
- Autonomy scoring determines when to act independently vs defer to a human
- The system reflects on its own extractions and improves from corrections over time

**Surfaces:**
- Gmail (operator surface — where finance works)
- Slack and Teams (action surfaces — where approvers act)
- ERP (system of record — where invoices post)
- Workspace console (ops surface — where finance handles exceptions)

## AP Invoice Processing

### Invoice Intake
- Invoices detected from Gmail inbox automatically (poll or push mode)
- Email body and PDF attachment extraction via Claude multimodal LLM
- Fields extracted: vendor name, amount, currency, invoice number, invoice date, due date, PO number, line items
- Per-field confidence scores
- Multi-mailbox support (multiple Gmail accounts per organization)
- Gmail labels auto-applied: Invoices, Needs Approval, Approved, Posted, Exceptions, Rejected

### AI Decision Engine
- Claude Sonnet evaluates each invoice with full vendor context
- Decisions: approve, needs_info, escalate, reject
- Each decision includes reasoning summary and risk flags
- Confidence-gated routing: below threshold routes to human
- Vendor profile context: payment history, reliability score, past corrections, anomaly flags
- Falls back to rule-based routing if API key missing or Claude unavailable

### Validation
- Deterministic validation gate (PO matching, budget checks, field completeness)
- Duplicate detection (vendor + amount + date matching)
- Amount anomaly detection (configurable standard deviation threshold)
- Three-way matching (invoice vs PO vs receipt)
- Policy compliance checks (approval thresholds, required fields, attachment requirements)

### AP State Machine
10 states with enforced transitions:
```
received → validated → needs_approval → approved → ready_to_post → posted_to_erp → closed
                     → needs_info (loops back to validated)
                     → rejected (terminal)
                     → failed_post (retryable → ready_to_post)
```
State transitions are atomic with audit events. Invalid transitions are blocked at the database level via triggers.

### GL Coding
- Auto-codes GL based on vendor history and past corrections
- Learns from every correction (correction_learning service)
- Per-vendor GL preferences stored in vendor profiles
- Custom GL mapping rules per organization
- Suggestions endpoint for real-time GL code recommendations

---

## Approval Routing

### Slack Integration
- Full approval cards with extracted invoice details
- Approve, Reject, Request Info buttons directly in Slack

### Microsoft Teams Integration
- Approval cards via webhook
- Approve, Reject, Request Info actions
- Webhook signature verification
- Configurable webhook URL per organization

### Approval Chains
- Hierarchical multi-step approval workflows
- Per-step approver lists with any/all approval types
- Chain status tracking (pending, approved, rejected per step)
- Escalation on timeout (configurable SLA)

### Approval Policies
- Amount-based thresholds (e.g., >$5,000 requires VP approval)
- Vendor-based rules (e.g., new vendors always require review)
- Policy versioning with full audit trail
- Override support with justification logging (budget, confidence, PO exception)

- Idempotent posting (prevents double-posts)

---

## Multi-Currency

- Supported in Trial, Pro, and Enterprise tiers
- Currency preserved through extraction, approval, and ERP posting
- Per-invoice currency (not per-organization)

---

## Vendor Intelligence

- Invoice count, average amount, amount standard deviation
- Anomaly flags (unusual amount, frequency change, bank detail changes)
- Approval override rate tracking
- Vendor compliance event logging
- Vendor directory with search (exposed in Gmail extension and API)
- Bulk vendor profile lookup for batch operations

---

## Agent Runtime

### Planning Engine
- Claude tool-use planning loop with durable execution
- Skills registry (register skills, dispatch by task type)
- Max 10 steps per task, 600-second timeout (configurable)
- Checkpointing before and after each step (crash-resumable)
- Human-in-the-loop pause (awaiting_human status)
- Idempotency support (same key = same result)
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-6 (configurable via AGENT_RUNTIME_MODEL)

### Finance Skills
- **AP Skill** — 5 tools: enrich_with_context (now includes cross-invoice analysis), run_validation_gate, get_ap_decision, execute_routing, request_vendor_info (creates Gmail draft for missing info)
- **Compound Skill** — Cross-skill orchestration: merges AP tools + vendor compliance snapshot + optional reconciliation tools in a single planning session. Claude decides which tools to call based on context.
- **Reconciliation Skill** — 4 tools: import_transactions (Google Sheets), match_transactions, flag_exceptions, write_results
- **Vendor Compliance Skill** — vendor compliance checks (exposed as planning tool via CompoundSkill adapter)
- **Workflow Health Skill** — workflow health monitoring

### Cross-Invoice Memory
- Duplicate detection results fed into the AP planning prompt
- Anomaly warnings (amount deviation, frequency spikes) visible to Claude during decision-making
- Vendor stats (invoice count, average amount, current vs average) included in enrichment
- Claude can see "DUPLICATE RISK: score 85%" and decide to escalate

### Vendor Outreach
- Agent creates Gmail draft requesting missing information from vendors (PO number, amount clarification, due date)
- Draft is NOT auto-sent — operator reviews and sends from Gmail
- Triggered when AP decision returns "needs_info" with a specific question
- Integrated into the planning loop as a tool Claude can call before routing

### Finance Agent Runtime
- Intent-based dispatch (preview before execute)
- Policy prechecks before every action
- Audit trail per action
- Autonomy scoring and shadow decisions
- Per-organization autonomy threshold overrides via org settings
- Background agent tasks and retry jobs
- Agent anomaly detection and performance monitoring

### Autonomy Levels
- **Level 1 (manual)**: Agent extracts and enriches, human does everything else
- **Level 2 (assisted)**: Agent routes low-risk invoices for approval, human approves
- **Level 3 (directed)**: Agent decides approve/escalate/reject, human confirms
- **Level 4 (autonomous with guardrails)**: Agent auto-approves trusted vendors, human reviews exceptions
- Autonomy earned per-vendor based on drift scoring, shadow decision accuracy, and post-verification rate
- Thresholds configurable per organization via `settings_json.autonomy_thresholds`

### ERP Posting Strategy
- API-first: tries native ERP API (QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, SAP)
- Browser fallback: if API fails, dispatches Playwright-based browser agent to post via ERP UI
- Reconciliation on completion: browser results feed back into AP state machine

### Browser Agent
- Playwright-based browser automation sessions
- Command execution with preview
- Predefined macros
- Policy-gated actions (requires_confirmation for sensitive operations)
- Full action event audit trail

## What Is NOT Built Yet

For honesty, these are mentioned in docs or UI but not fully implemented:

- **SSO/SAML** — Gated in Enterprise tier, not implemented
- **Multi-entity within one org** — Org-level isolation exists, but not subsidiary/division routing from one inbox
- **Oracle ERP** — Not implemented (only NetSuite, which Oracle owns)
- **SOC 2 compliance** — No certification process started
- **Dedicated infrastructure** — Enterprise tier feature, not built
