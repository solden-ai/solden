# Solden AP v1 Embedded Operator Experience

This document describes the **embedded AP v1 operator experience** across Gmail, Slack, and Teams.

It aligns to the canonical doctrine in:

- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/PLAN.md`

Related implementation roadmap (post-hardening product-expression work):

- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/AGENTIC_UX_V1_5_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

## Purpose

Define the user-facing behavior of the AP v1 embedded experience so the product feels:
1. inbox-native
2. agentic (not a generic automation tool)
3. trustworthy
4. low-clutter

Note: The current codebase already contains agent runtime, browser-agent tooling, and Gmail agent session rendering primitives. The v1.5 roadmap focuses on making those capabilities more visible and operator-centric without changing AP v1 doctrine.

## Product Shape (AP v1)

- **Gmail** = context + status + exceptions + next action for the active record
- **Pipeline** = queue control, saved views, prioritization, and record reopening
- **Slack / Teams** = approvals and escalation decisions
- **ERP** = system of record
- **Workspace Shell** = setup/ops only (not daily AP processing)

## Core UX Principles

1. **Decision-first**
   - Show what the operator needs to decide now.
   - Hide technical details and raw payloads by default.

2. **Agentic but transparent**
   - The agent can gather context and propose/execute steps.
   - The UI must always show what happened, what is blocked, and what is next.

3. **Progressive disclosure**
   - Summary first.
   - Context tabs and audit details only when needed.

4. **No mini-dashboard in Gmail**
   - Gmail thread panel is a focused workspace, not a full AP console.

5. **Consistent semantics across Slack and Teams**
   - Approval actions and outcomes should feel equivalent even if channel UI differs.

## Gmail Experience (Current-Record Surface)

### AP Workspace (Thread-Level)

When Solden identifies an AP item in a thread, Gmail should show a focused workspace for the active record with:

1. **Status**
   - Current AP state (for example `validating`, `needs_info`, `needs_approval`, `ready_to_post`, `posted`)

2. **Key extracted fields**
   - vendor
   - invoice number
   - amount
   - due date

3. **Exceptions**
   - reason-coded blockers (duplicate risk, low confidence, PO mismatch, budget issue, posting failure)

4. **Next action**
   - one clear action (review, request info, route approval, retry post, etc.)

5. **Audit breadcrumbs**
   - compact human-readable history (approved by X, rejected by Y, posted to ERP at Z)

### Gmail Sections (progressive disclosure)

Default-visible:
1. primary invoice summary
2. status and exception summary
3. next action

Collapsed by default:
1. sources (linked emails/threads)
2. full context tabs
3. technical details (IDs, payload fragments, traces)
4. full audit event list

### Gmail Empty/Idle States

Avoid dashboard-style filler panels.

Preferred behavior:
1. single compact status line
2. actionable message only when needed
3. no large empty KPI/audit sections

### Gmail Operator Actions (examples)

Allowed actions depend on state/policy:
1. request info
2. submit for approval / re-route approval
3. approve with override (with required justification)
4. retry posting (legal states only)
5. open source email / open linked source

No action may bypass server-side state validation or policy enforcement.

## Pipeline Experience (Queue Control Surface)

`Pipeline` is where finance operators should:

1. sort and filter the AP queue
2. save views they reopen often
3. prioritize across entities and states
4. reopen the next active record in Gmail context
5. watch approval backlog, exception backlog, and posting backlog without turning Gmail threads into dashboards

## Slack and Teams Experience (Approval/Decision Surfaces)

### Role in the AP workflow

Slack and Teams are where approvers make decisions. They are not full workflow dashboards.

### Approval card requirements

Each card should include:
1. invoice summary
2. validation summary and exception highlights
3. requested action
4. action buttons:
   - approve
   - reject
   - request info
5. clear result feedback
6. link back to Gmail/AP context

### Channel action behavior requirements

1. Duplicate clicks/callbacks are safe and idempotent.
2. Invalid/stale actions return clear feedback.
3. All action outcomes are audited.
4. Slack and Teams support equivalent AP decision semantics.

## Agentic Transparency Patterns (Required)

To preserve trust, the UI should reveal agent behavior without overwhelming users.

### Show in primary flow

1. what state the agent is in
2. what blocked progress (if blocked)
3. what the next step is
4. whether human confirmation is required

### Show on demand

1. validation details
2. source evidence
3. execution history
4. posting preview details (for high-risk/fallback paths)

## Experience Anti-Patterns (Do Not Ship)

1. Gmail panel as global navigation hub
2. Gmail panel as dense multi-section dashboard
3. Technical text in the primary decision area
4. Inconsistent Slack vs Teams decision semantics
5. Hidden failure states ("looks successful" but actually blocked)

## Workspace Shell Boundary (Explicit)

Workspace Shell responsibilities:
1. integration setup
2. policy configuration
3. org/team settings
4. health and diagnostics
5. subscription/plan management

The Workspace Shell is **not** the daily AP operator workflow UI for AP v1.

## UX Acceptance Checklist (AP v1)

1. Operator can process the current invoice from Gmail without reading raw technical data.
2. Gmail panel defaults to one active item and low-clutter summary.
3. Slack and Teams approval cards support equivalent actions and outcomes.
4. Exceptions are clearly reason-coded and actionable.
5. Audit breadcrumbs are visible in-context with deeper detail on demand.
6. The product feels like embedded operational memory, not a generic automation panel.
