# Engineering Handoff (2026-02-26)

## Purpose

This document summarizes the current branch state for engineering handoff, with focus on:

- AP v1 plan-alignment hardening and launch-readiness work
- Agentic UX v1.5 work (AX1-AX7 initial implementation)
- Validation coverage added on this branch
- Operational and merge caveats (including local/test artifacts currently present)

Treat `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/PLAN.md` as the canonical product/architecture source of truth.

## Branch / PR

- PR: `#1` (`main <- codex/section7-browser-agent-20260218-090056`)
- PR URL: `https://github.com/clearledgr/Clearledgr-AP/pull/1`

## What Landed on This Branch (High-Level)

### 1) AP v1 plan-alignment and hardening

- Canonical AP state machine runtime alignment (state transitions, failure semantics)
- Confidence gating + worklist blocker fields + server-side enforcement
- Slack/Teams callback security + normalized action contract + idempotency
- ERP API-first + browser fallback preview/confirmation/audit improvements
- Audit completeness/immutability improvements
- Launch controls (rollback controls + GA readiness metadata)
- Durable retry queue for agent/orchestration retry path (DB-backed)

Tracking docs (archived as completed):
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/archive/PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION_GAP_TRACKER_2026-02-25_COMPLETE.md`
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/archive/PLAN_REMAINING_GAPS_TRACKER_2026-02-25_COMPLETE.md`

### 2) Launch-readiness execution scaffolding

- Launch tracker + evidence templates + release manifest scaffold
- GA evidence process docs / runbook-oriented docs

Primary docs:
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/GA_LAUNCH_READINESS_TRACKER.md`
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/GA_READINESS_EVIDENCE_PROCESS.md`
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/ga-evidence/releases/ap-v1-2026-02-25-pilot-rc1/`

### 3) Agentic UX v1.5 (AX1-AX7 initial pass)

Implemented on the Gmail-first embedded surface without removing deterministic AP controls:

- AX1: Agent timeline in Gmail (agent + audit execution narrative)
- AX2: Bounded non-debug agent actions + command bar (intent-mapped, preview-first)
- AX3: Proactive outcomes (nudge approvers, finance summary share with preview + multi-target support)
- AX4: Batch agent ops (preview/run, policies, per-item results, rerun failed subset)
- AX5: Browser fallback trust UX (timeline stages, fallback status banner, evidence cues)
- AX6: Agentic KPI + telemetry layer (backend `agentic_telemetry` + Gmail debug KPI rendering)
- AX7: Slack/Teams agentic presentation parity (why/what-next/requested-by/source-of-truth copy)

Roadmap + landed notes:
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/AGENTIC_UX_V1_5_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

### 4) Gmail extension frontend test infrastructure improvements

- Helper/render unit-like harness (AX1-AX5/AX6 render logic)
- Browserless InboxSDK integration harness (DOM lifecycle + event wiring + mocked InboxSDK)

Key files:
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/ui/gmail-extension/tests/inboxsdk-layer-harness.cjs`
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/ui/gmail-extension/tests/inboxsdk-integration-harness.cjs`
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/ui/gmail-extension/tests/inboxsdk-layer-ui.test.cjs`
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/ui/gmail-extension/tests/inboxsdk-layer.integration.test.cjs`

### 5) Invoice extraction benchmark + parser improvements

- Added a repeatable extraction evaluator and benchmark dataset
- Improved amount candidate scoring and payment-request fallback
- Tightened vendor fuzzy matching to avoid false positives (e.g., `Taskforce -> Salesforce`)

Key files:
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/scripts/evaluate_invoice_extraction.py`
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/tests/test_data/invoice_extraction_eval_cases.json`
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/tests/test_email_parser_amount_selection.py`

## Current Product Shape (Important for Handoff)

Solden remains an **embedded, agentic AP execution layer**:

- Gmail = primary operator workspace
- Slack/Teams = approval decision surfaces
- ERP = write-back system of record
- Browser agent = governed fallback execution path
- Deterministic state machine/policy/audit remain server-enforced

This branch intentionally improves the *agentic feel* (timeline/actions/proactive outputs/trust UX) without turning the product into a generic automation platform.

## Recommended Reading Order (Engineering)

1. `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/PLAN.md`
2. `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md`
3. `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/AGENTIC_UX_V1_5_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
4. `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/GA_LAUNCH_READINESS_TRACKER.md`
5. `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/GA_READINESS_EVIDENCE_PROCESS.md`
6. Archived trackers (for implementation evidence and rationale)

## Validation Snapshot (Most Recent on Branch)

Representative validations run across this branch workstream include:

- Gmail extension tests (`npm test`) covering AX1-AX6/AX5/AX4 integration harness flows:
  - `15 passed` (latest run)
- AX6 backend KPI telemetry checks:
  - `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/tests/test_browser_agent_layer.py` targeted run → `2 passed`
- AX7 channel parity tests:
  - `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/tests/test_channel_approval_contract.py` → `10 passed`
- Additional prior AP v1 regression slices and hardening suites were executed during implementation (see archived trackers and launch tracker notes).

Note:
- InboxSDK test coverage is now strong at helper + browserless integration layers.
- Real Gmail/Chrome runtime E2E remains a separate follow-on layer (not fully implemented here).

## What Engineering Should Validate Before Merge / Pilot

1. Run the intended regression suite for your merge bar (backend + Gmail extension tests).
2. Review `ui/gmail-extension/dist/inboxsdk-layer.js` build artifact alignment with `src/` changes.
3. Execute staging drills from:
   - `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/STAGING_DRILL_RUNBOOK.md`
4. Update launch tracker evidence links/results in:
   - `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/GA_LAUNCH_READINESS_TRACKER.md`
5. Confirm env/config parity using:
   - `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/env.example`
   - `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/README.md`

## Merge / Repo Hygiene Caveats (Important)

Local/test artifacts were temporarily committed during the workstream and then cleaned up in a follow-up hygiene commit.
They are now ignored to avoid reintroduction.

Ignore coverage now includes:

- `*.sqlite3` / local DB state files
- `.claude/settings.local.json`
- repo-root local screenshots (e.g., `Screenshot *.png`, `Claude rules.jpeg`)

Engineering can still choose to store demonstration screenshots/evidence in a dedicated docs asset path, but they should be intentionally placed and named (not left as local desktop exports in repo root).

## Suggested Immediate Next Steps After Handoff

1. Launch readiness execution (staging drills, parity evidence, signoffs)
2. Authenticated Gmail pilot run using `npm run test:e2e-auth` with evidence capture
3. GA evidence artifact population and release manifest updates
4. Pilot feedback pass (microcopy and workflow ergonomics only, no contract changes)

## Handoff Status

- Branch is implementation-heavy and documentation-backed.
- Core AP v1 hardening and agentic UX v1.5 initial passes are in place.
- Launch execution/proof work is the main remaining program.
