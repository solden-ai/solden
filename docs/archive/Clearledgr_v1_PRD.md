Solden AP v1 — Embedded Execution for Accounts Payable

1. Product Overview

Product name: Solden AP
Version: v1 (MVP)
Category: Embedded finance workflow execution

Solden AP is an embedded execution layer for accounts payable.
It runs inside the tools finance teams already use, starting with email, and executes AP workflows end-to-end across email, spreadsheets, approvals, and ERP systems.

Solden does not introduce a new dashboard or destination.
It performs the work where it starts.


2. Problem Statement

Modern AP workflows span multiple systems:
	•	Invoices and payment requests arrive via email
	•	Validation happens in spreadsheets or internal tools
	•	Approvals happen in chat or email threads
	•	Posting happens in the ERP
	•	Exceptions are resolved manually via follow-ups

Finance teams manually stitch these systems together.
Most software stops at dashboards, task tracking, or classification.
The actual execution work is still done by humans.

The bottleneck is not data availability.
It is the manual coordination and execution across systems.


3. Product Principles (v1)
	1.	Execution over visibility
Solden performs actions. It does not just surface data.
	2.	Embedded, not destination
Users do not log into Solden. Solden appears where work already happens.
	3.	Deterministic state, not brittle automation
AP is modeled as a state machine, not a collection of scripts.
	4.	Human-in-the-loop by design
Humans intervene only where judgment is required.
	5.	Minimal surface area, real depth
One workflow, executed fully, on real data.


4. Scope Definition

In Scope (v1)
	•	Accounts Payable execution
	•	Email as the primary intake surface (Gmail)
	•	Multi-item AP processing
	•	Approvals and exceptions
	•	Posting to ERP
	•	Audit trail generation

Explicitly Out of Scope (v1)
	•	Payment execution
	•	Vendor portals
	•	PO lifecycle management
	•	Expense management
	•	Multi-entity accounting
	•	Custom approval builders
	•	Standalone dashboards


5. Core Object Model

AP Item (primary object)

An AP Item represents any payable obligation, including:
	•	Invoice
	•	Payment request
	•	Credit note
	•	Vendor follow-up

Each AP Item contains:
	•	Vendor identity
	•	Amount and currency
	•	Due date
	•	Supporting documents
	•	Source email thread
	•	Approval status
	•	ERP reference (once posted)
	•	Execution log

AP Items can be created, updated, and resolved independently and in parallel.


6. AP State Machine (v1)

Each AP Item progresses through a deterministic state machine.

Primary States

RECEIVED
→ VALIDATED
→ NEEDS_APPROVAL
→ APPROVED
→ READY_TO_POST
→ POSTED_TO_ERP
→ CLOSED

Exception States

VALIDATED → NEEDS_INFO
APPROVED → REJECTED
READY_TO_POST → FAILED_POST

State transitions are executed by agents, not users.


7. Workflow Execution (v1)

7.1 Intake
	•	Solden detects invoices and payment requests in email threads
	•	Extracts structured data from attachments and email body
	•	Creates or updates AP Items automatically

7.2 Validation
	•	Agent checks:
	•	Duplicate submissions
	•	Vendor match
	•	Amount sanity
	•	Required documents
	•	Flags issues and moves item to exception state if needed

7.3 Approvals
	•	Agent determines if approval is required
	•	Requests approval inline via email or chat
	•	Tracks approval outcome and timestamps
	•	No approval UI to configure in v1

7.4 ERP Posting
	•	Once approved, agent prepares posting payload
	•	Posts to ERP
	•	Confirms success or failure
	•	Writes ERP reference back to AP Item

7.5 Closure
	•	AP Item is marked closed
	•	Execution summary is logged
	•	Original email thread is updated with outcome


8. User Experience (v1)

Where users interact
	1.	Inline in email threads
	•	AP status
	•	Required actions
	•	Execution updates
	2.	Embedded AP queue
	•	List of AP Items and states
	•	No dashboards, no charts
	•	Read-only state overview
	3.	ERP confirmation
	•	Final system of record

There is no separate Solden application.


9. Human-in-the-Loop Design

Humans are required only for:
	•	Approvals
	•	Clarifying missing or incorrect information
	•	Optional final confirmation before ERP posting

All other work is automated.


10. Audit & Traceability

For every AP Item, Solden records:
	•	Source inputs
	•	State transitions
	•	Agent actions
	•	Human interventions
	•	ERP posting references
	•	Timestamps

This creates a complete, replayable audit trail.


11. Architecture Overview (v1)

Frontend
	•	Gmail embedded UI (InboxSDK)
	•	Inline thread components
	•	Lightweight embedded queue panel

Backend
	•	Workflow orchestration engine
	•	Durable execution for state transitions
	•	ERP integration service
	•	Configuration and logging service

AI Agents
	•	Document understanding
	•	Validation reasoning
	•	Approval coordination
	•	Execution planning

Agents are task-specific and tool-enabled.


12. Success Metrics (v1)
	•	≥60% reduction in AP handling time
	•	≥80% of AP Items processed end-to-end without manual stitching
	•	Zero requirement for users to log into a new tool
	•	Successful ERP posting with full audit trail


13. Positioning

Solden AP is not invoice automation.
It is not a dashboard.
It is not an RPA script.

It is an embedded execution system for accounts payable, designed to run where finance work actually happens and eliminate the stitching work that software has ignored for decades.
