# Solden Agentic Autonomy Next Program (HITL-Preserved)

## Objective
Maximize safe agentic autonomy for AP workflows while preserving non-negotiable human-in-the-loop controls for risky actions.

This program does **not** target zero-HITL autonomy. It targets:
- autonomous execution for low-risk paths
- proactive recovery and routing by the agent
- explicit human confirmations at policy/risk boundaries

## Guardrails (Locked)
1. Keep Gmail as primary operator surface.
2. Keep Slack/Teams as approval decision surfaces.
3. Keep deterministic policy gates (budget, confidence, PO/exception, auth).
4. No silent state changes: all fallback/retry/override outcomes must be auditable.
5. No generic automation-builder pivot.

## Execution Plan (Next 2–4 weeks)

## Phase A (P0): High-Leverage Autonomy Gains With Existing Architecture

### A1. Vendor Follow-up Autonomy Loop (Draft → Track → Reconcile)
**Goal**
Close the current “request info” loop with stronger agent ownership after human-triggered request-info decisions.

**Implementation**
- Extend follow-up state metadata for each AP item:
  - `needs_info_draft_id`, `followup_last_sent_at`, `followup_attempt_count`, `followup_next_action`.
- Add controlled nudge scheduling for unanswered vendor requests (draft-first or resend template with guardrails).
- Surface follow-up progress in Gmail timeline/operator brief.

**Code touchpoints**
- `clearledgr/services/invoice_workflow.py`
- `clearledgr/services/auto_followup.py`
- `clearledgr/api/gmail_extension.py`
- `clearledgr/core/stores/ap_store.py`

**Acceptance tests**
- Request-info action creates/links draft and follow-up metadata.
- If no response by SLA window, agent proposes or queues next nudge (without auto-sending high-risk actions).
- Gmail thread context clearly shows follow-up state and next operator action.

### Landed (A1 pass)
1. Added normalized `needs_info` follow-up metadata persistence in workflow paths:
   - `needs_info_draft_id`
   - `followup_last_sent_at`
   - `followup_attempt_count`
   - `followup_next_action`
   - `followup_sla_due_at`
2. Added guarded `POST /extension/vendor-followup` action to prepare/re-prepare vendor follow-up drafts with SLA/attempt guardrails (draft-first, never auto-send).
3. Extended worklist payload + Gmail sidebar/operator brief rendering to show follow-up progress and next action guidance.
4. Added regression tests for workflow metadata, extension endpoint behavior, and Gmail sidebar rendering coverage.

### A2. Policy-Aware Batch Autonomy Expansion (Still Preview-First)
**Goal**
Increase throughput by safely broadening batch operations beyond current retry/posting/nudge primitives.

**Landed (2026-02-27)**
- Added batch intents in Gmail sidebar Batch Agent Ops:
  - `prepare_vendor_followups`
  - `route_low_risk_for_approval`
  - `retry_recoverable_failures`
- Added deterministic preview policy outputs with selected/excluded reason summaries.
- Added run-path idempotency key propagation per batch item.
- Added secured extension endpoints for low-risk approval routing + recoverable retries.
- Added workflow/state precheck helpers for low-risk approval routing and recoverable retry classification.
- Added UI + API + workflow acceptance coverage for preview determinism, run outcomes, and idempotent replay.

### Agent Core Runtime Seam (Platform Direction)
**Landed (initial)**
- Added a canonical finance-agent intent contract:
  - `POST /api/agent/intents/preview`
  - `POST /api/agent/intents/execute`
- Added `FinanceAgentRuntime` as the backend intent runtime seam (`clearledgr/services/finance_agent_runtime.py`).
- Routed the existing `route_low_risk_for_approval` AP action through the runtime to preserve backward compatibility while establishing an agent-first platform boundary.

**Landed (expanded)**
- Extended runtime intents to include:
  - `prepare_vendor_followups`
  - `retry_recoverable_failures`
- Preserved intent-level idempotency replay and per-item runtime audit trails across all three batch intents.
- Updated Gmail extension queue-manager execution paths to use canonical `POST /api/agent/intents/execute` as the single batch-intent execution path.
- Converted legacy extension batch endpoints into runtime adapters so execution logic lives only in `FinanceAgentRuntime`.
- Added explicit skill packaging under the runtime:
  - `FinanceSkill` contract (`preview`, `execute`, `policy_precheck`, `audit_contract`)
  - `APFinanceSkill` module for AP intents
  - `WorkflowHealthSkill` read-only module (`read_ap_workflow_health`) as the first non-AP expansion proof.

**Implementation**
- Add new batch intents with explicit policy prechecks:
  - `prepare_vendor_followups`
  - `route_low_risk_for_approval`
  - `retry_recoverable_failures`
- Keep preview/run split; keep per-item outcomes and idempotency keys.
- Add policy summaries to batch preview (why selected, why excluded).

**Code touchpoints**
- `ui/gmail-extension/src/inboxsdk-layer.js`
- `clearledgr/api/gmail_extension.py`
- `clearledgr/services/invoice_workflow.py`
- `clearledgr/core/ap_states.py`

**Acceptance tests**
- Preview returns deterministic selected/excluded sets with reasons.
- Run path executes only preview-eligible items and emits per-item audit events.
- Duplicate batch runs remain idempotent.

---

### A3. Recommendation Calibration Layer (Tenant-Specific)
**Goal**
Improve decision quality consistency by calibrating recommendation thresholds using observed human outcomes.

**Implementation**
- Build per-tenant calibration profile from feedback:
  - reject-after-approve ratio
  - request-info-after-approve ratio
  - override rate by decision type.
- Inject calibration into AP decision context and fallback scoring, while preserving hard gates.
- Add operator-visible “calibration active” telemetry.

**Code touchpoints**
- `clearledgr/services/ap_decision.py`
- `clearledgr/core/stores/vendor_store.py`
- `clearledgr/api/ops.py`
- `clearledgr/core/stores/metrics_store.py`

**Acceptance tests**
- With strict calibration profile, borderline approvals route to human review.
- With permissive profile and clean history, low-risk approvals increase.
- Calibration shifts are observable in metrics snapshots.

---

## Phase B (P1): Reliability and Runtime Autonomy Maturity

### B1. Durable Agent Task Queue for Proactive Jobs
**Goal**
Make proactive/autonomous actions restart-safe and auditable end-to-end.

**Implementation**
- Add durable queue entries for:
  - approval nudges
  - vendor follow-up nudges
  - retry-post operations
  - periodic AP health scans.
- Persist next-run timestamps, attempts, status, and terminal outcomes.
- Ensure background workers only execute durable jobs (no fire-and-forget gaps).

**Code touchpoints**
- `clearledgr/services/agent_background.py`
- `clearledgr/core/database.py`
- `clearledgr/core/stores/*` (job persistence APIs)
- `clearledgr/services/invoice_workflow.py`

**Acceptance tests**
- Queued proactive jobs survive process restart.
- Job retries back off and terminate correctly after max attempts.
- Audit trail links job execution to affected AP item(s).

---

### B2. Agent Decision Explainability Contract (Operator-Grade)
**Goal**
Make every recommendation instantly understandable and actionable.

**Implementation**
- Standardize explanation fields across Gmail/Slack/Teams:
  - `what_happened`, `why_now`, `recommended_now`, `expected_outcome`, `risk_notes`.
- Ensure every action button has matching expected-outcome language.
- Add compact confidence + policy blocker annotations.

**Code touchpoints**
- `ui/gmail-extension/src/inboxsdk-layer.js`
- `clearledgr/services/invoice_workflow.py`
- `clearledgr/services/slack_api.py`
- `clearledgr/services/teams_api.py`

**Acceptance tests**
- All action surfaces render the explanation contract.
- Edge cases (budget hard block, confidence review, duplicate risk, fallback pending) have deterministic copy branches.
- No surface falls back to raw debug/internal labels by default.

---

### B3. Browser Runner Trust Hardening (External Runner Ready)
**Goal**
Keep browser fallback agentic while tightening trust boundaries for externalized runners.

**Implementation**
- Require signed runner identity + scoped session claims for completion callbacks.
- Enforce callback replay protection and strict idempotency windows.
- Add callback integrity evidence to audit metadata.

**Code touchpoints**
- `clearledgr/api/agent_sessions.py`
- `clearledgr/services/browser_agent.py`
- `clearledgr/core/auth.py`
- `tests/test_browser_agent_layer.py`

**Acceptance tests**
- Unauthorized/expired/replayed callbacks are rejected and audited.
- Valid signed callback finalizes state exactly once.
- Reconciled completion always updates AP state and timeline.

---

## Phase C (P2): Productized Agent Autonomy Signals

### C1. Autonomy Scoreboard (Operator + Admin Views)
**Goal**
Make agent value and control balance measurable in daily operations.

**Implementation**
- Add autonomy scorecard tiles:
  - autonomous completion rate (policy-safe)
  - human-intervention rate by reason
  - recovery success rate
  - time-to-resolution reduction.
- Show trend windows (7d/30d) and top blockers.

**Code touchpoints**
- `clearledgr/api/analytics.py`
- `clearledgr/api/ops.py`
- `ui/gmail-extension/src/inboxsdk-layer.js`
- `clearledgr/core/stores/metrics_store.py`

**Acceptance tests**
- Metrics contract stable across ops/admin/Gmail surfaces.
- Ratios are computed from canonical audited events only.
- Missing data degrades gracefully with explicit “insufficient data” signaling.

---

### C2. Tenant Policy Templates for Safe Autonomy Expansion
**Goal**
Enable gradual autonomy increase without code changes.

**Implementation**
- Add policy profiles:
  - `conservative`, `balanced`, `throughput`.
- Profiles tune low-risk thresholds and proactive limits, never bypassing hard controls.
- Provide profile diff preview before apply.

**Code touchpoints**
- `clearledgr/api/settings.py`
- `clearledgr/services/invoice_workflow.py`
- `clearledgr/api/gmail_extension.py`

**Acceptance tests**
- Profile changes alter routing/autonomy behavior predictably.
- Hard gates remain enforced under every profile.
- Profile changes are audited with actor and timestamp.
