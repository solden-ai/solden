## D. Platform Capabilities

### 20. [MISSING] Payment execution
**Priority:** P3
**What's missing:** No payment triggering after approval. Solden posts the bill but finance still triggers payment in ERP.
**What's needed:**
- Payment run integration (batch payments via ERP API)
- Payment method selection (ACH, wire, check)
- Payment approval workflow (separate from invoice approval)
**Estimated effort:** 7-10 days

- 21 tests covering store, HMAC, delivery, emission, retry, and API endpoints

### 25. [N/A] Mobile app or mobile-optimized view
**Priority:** N/A
**Status:** Not applicable — by design, Solden renders inside Gmail (extension sidebar) and Outlook (add-in taskpane), which are already responsive. Approvals route to Slack/Teams mobile. No standalone app surface exists for daily use. Workspace admin console is setup-only, not a daily workflow surface.

### 26. [DONE] Audit trail export
**Priority:** P1

**What was built:**
- `GET /api/ap/items/audit/export` endpoint with CSV and JSON formats
- Filters: date range, vendor, state
- Streaming CSV response for large exports
- All audit event types with full detail

### 27. [N/A] SSO/SAML implementation
**Priority:** N/A
**Status:** Not applicable — Solden authenticates through the email provider (Gmail Chrome identity, Outlook Office SSO) and messaging platform (Slack/Teams OAuth). There is no standalone login surface where SSO/SAML would apply. Enterprise identity is inherited from the host platform.

---

## E. Security & Infrastructure

### 28. [DEFERRED] SOC 2 certification
**Priority:** P2 (enterprise requirement)
**Status:** Technical controls built, formal audit not started.
**Why it matters:** Solden reads invoices from customer inboxes, sends them to Claude for extraction, stores extracted financial data (amounts, vendors, line items), and holds OAuth tokens with inbox read access. Enterprise procurement requires SOC 2 for this data handling profile.
**What's already built (code-level controls):**
- Fernet encryption at rest for all tokens/secrets
- Append-only audit trail with DB triggers (no UPDATE/DELETE on audit_events)
- Tenant isolation (organization_id on every query, verified at API layer)
- Minimal OAuth scopes per provider
- HMAC-SHA256 webhook signatures
**What's needed (process, not code):**
- Engage Vanta/Drata for automated compliance monitoring
- Document controls mapping to SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria
- Complete Type II audit (~3-6 month observation period)
**Estimated effort:** 3-6 months (process work, minimal code changes)

### 29. [DONE] Database migrations
**Priority:** P2
**Status:** Completed 2026-04-04
**What was built:**
- `solden/core/migrations.py` — lightweight migration framework (no Alembic)
- `schema_versions` table tracks applied migrations with timestamps
- `@migration(version, description)` decorator for numbered migrations
- Runs on startup after initialize(), only applies pending versions
- 6 initial migrations covering all new tables and columns from this session
- New schema changes go as migrations, not _ensure_column calls

### 30. [DONE] Monitoring/alerting integration
**Priority:** P2
**Status:** Completed 2026-04-04
**What was built:**
- Sentry SDK integration in `main.py` — opt-in via `SENTRY_DSN` env var, FastAPI + httpx integrations, configurable trace sample rate
- `solden/services/monitoring.py` — MonitoringService with 5 threshold checks: dead letters, auth failures, stale autopilot, overdue invoices, posting failure rate
- Alerts emitted to configurable channels (slack, webhook, log) via `MONITOR_ALERT_CHANNELS` env var
- Critical alerts also captured as Sentry events
- All thresholds overridable via `MONITOR_THRESHOLD_*` env vars
- `GET /api/ops/monitoring-health` endpoint for on-demand health checks
- Runs hourly in background loop (alongside anomaly detection)
- 16 tests covering all checks, thresholds, alerts, API, and background wiring

---

## F. Data Quality

### 31. [PARTIAL] Non-English invoice handling
**Priority:** P3
**What exists:** Claude supports many languages. Extraction prompts are English-only.
**What's needed:**
- Language detection on incoming emails
- Localized extraction prompts (or explicit "extract regardless of language" instruction)
- Field mapping for common non-English labels (Facture, Montant, Fälligkeitsdatum, etc.)
**Estimated effort:** 2-3 days

### 32. [DONE] Duplicate vendor consolidation
**Priority:** P2
**Status:** Completed 2026-04-04
**What was built:**
- `solden/services/vendor_dedup.py` — VendorDedupService with detect, merge, alias management, and name resolution
- Detection: fuzzy matching via existing `vendor_similarity()` (Jaccard + SequenceMatcher), configurable threshold, returns ranked clusters with canonical suggestion (most invoices)
- Merge: consolidates aliases, reassigns AP items to canonical, deletes duplicate profiles
- Alias management: add/remove aliases on vendor_aliases JSON array, idempotent
- Name resolution: `resolve_vendor_name()` maps any alias to its canonical vendor
- API: `GET /vendor-intelligence/duplicates`, `POST /vendor-intelligence/merge`, `POST/DELETE .../aliases`
- 19 tests covering detection, merge, aliases, resolution, and API endpoints

### 33. [N/A] Historical data import
**Priority:** N/A
**Status:** Not needed — Solden processes invoices as they arrive (Streak model). Historical AP data lives in the ERP (already readable via chart of accounts, vendor list, payment status APIs). The existing `/extension/repair-historical-invoices` handles the one valid case: backfilling Gmail emails that arrived before Solden was connected.

---

## G. AP Lifecycle Completeness

### 34. [DONE] Auto-close after payment
**Priority:** P1
**Status:** Already built (part of #8 payment tracking implementation)
**What exists:**
- Full payment detected → `posted_to_erp` → `closed` with audit event `closed_by_payment` (agent_background.py:947-966)
- Credit/write-off closure → `posted_to_erp` → `closed` with audit event `closed_by_credit` (agent_background.py:879-898)
- Partial payment does NOT close — waits for full payment
- Slack notifications on both payment completion and credit closure
- Payment events logged in payment_events table

### 35. [DONE] Dispute/exception workflow
**Priority:** P2
**Status:** Completed 2026-04-04
**What was built:**

- `solden/core/stores/dispute_store.py` — DisputeStore mixin with full CRUD
- `solden/services/dispute_service.py` — DisputeService with lifecycle: open → vendor_contacted → response_received → resolved/escalated/closed
- 8 dispute types: missing_po, wrong_amount, vendor_mismatch, missing_info, duplicate, bank_detail_change, erp_sync_mismatch, other
- Summary endpoint with counts by status and type
- Existing background infrastructure already handles: vendor reply detection (30 min scan), auto-escalation, follow-up resend, Slack notifications
- API: `GET/POST /disputes`, `GET /disputes/summary`, `POST /disputes/{id}/resolve`, `POST /disputes/{id}/escalate`
- 18 tests covering store, service lifecycle, summary, and API endpoints

### 36. [DONE] Approval delegation
**Priority:** P2

- `auto_reassign_pending_approvals()` wired into background approval timeout checks — reassigns pending chains to delegates
- API: `GET/POST /delegation-rules`, `POST /delegation-rules/{id}/deactivate`
- 16 tests covering rules, resolution, date ranges, and API endpoints

### 37. [DONE] Month-end accrual cutoff
**Priority:** P2
**Status:** Completed 2026-04-04

- Backdate detection: finds invoices received after cutoff that belong to the prior period
- Accrual report: uninvoiced liabilities by vendor, currency-aware, for any period
- Current period detection with closing window and days-until-close
- `check_posting_allowed()` for integration into validation gate
- API: `GET /period-close/current`, `GET /period-close/accruals/{period}`, `GET /period-close/backdated/{period}`, `POST /period-close/lock/{period}`, `POST /period-close/unlock/{period}`
- 18 tests covering detection, lock/unlock, accruals, backdating, config, and API

### 38. [DONE] Vendor statement reconciliation

**Status:** Completed 2026-04-04
**What was built:**
- `solden/services/vendor_statement_recon.py` — VendorStatementRecon with 4-tier matching strategy
- Matching: exact reference → partial reference → amount+date proximity (5-day tolerance) → amount-only
- Output: matched items, amount discrepancies, unmatched on statement, unmatched in Solden
