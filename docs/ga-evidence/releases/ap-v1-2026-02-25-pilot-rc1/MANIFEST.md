# Release Evidence Manifest

Release ID: `ap-v1-2026-02-25-pilot-rc1`
Mode: `pilot`
Created: `2026-02-25`
Status: `finalized`
Owner: `platform-eng`

Source doctrine:

Implementation baseline (completed):
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/archive/PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION_GAP_TRACKER_2026-02-25_COMPLETE.md`
- `/Users/mombalam/Desktop/Solden.v1/docs/archive/PLAN_REMAINING_GAPS_TRACKER_2026-02-25_COMPLETE.md`

## Implementation Snapshot

This manifest records pilot evidence collection on top of an implemented AP v1 codebase, not a partially built product.

- Gmail is the primary embedded operator surface with a thread workspace and Gmail-native routed pages.
- Backend Gmail autopilot, invoice validation/workflow, approval routing, audit capture, and ops/readiness APIs are implemented.
- Slack and Teams approval callbacks are implemented and covered by handler-path tests.
- ERP execution is API-primary across QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, and SAP, with browser fallback controls for unsupported or staged paths.

Pending items in this manifest are live-environment capture and operational proof gaps, not absence of the core AP product.

## Open Accepted Risks (Pilot Only)

- None currently in `R01-R14` tracker scope (`R01-R14` all closed).
- Add pilot-only launch waivers here if failure-mode or parity coverage is deferred.

## Readiness Summary (to update)

Repository-local evidence is stronger than live-environment verification. Where broad-launch claims still require staging or sandbox proof, that is called out in the notes below and in the release scope above.
