# GA Launch Readiness Tracker (Execution Phase)

Date created: 2026-02-25
Source doctrine: `PLAN.md`
Evidence process: `docs/GA_READINESS_EVIDENCE_PROCESS.md`

Implementation baseline (completed and archived):
- `docs/archive/PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION_GAP_TRACKER_2026-02-25_COMPLETE.md`
- `docs/archive/PLAN_REMAINING_GAPS_TRACKER_2026-02-25_COMPLETE.md`

Latest validation baseline:
- AP v1 regression slice + durable retry tests: `114 passed` (recorded in remaining-gaps tracker archive)
- Full backend test suite (2026-04-12 post-Phase-3.5 commits `50a8851`, `cd40c7b`, `38da54a`): **2066 passed** (3 pre-existing test-ordering flakes that pass in isolation)
- Frontend component contract tests (2026-04-12): 23/23 passing (ThreadSidebar 10 + BatchOps 10 + ActionDialog 3)

## Implementation Snapshot

AP v1 is already implemented in code and test-covered beyond the archived remediation trackers.

- Gmail autopilot exists as a backend service with catch-up and background polling.
- Gmail is a real embedded product surface with thread execution UX plus routed pages for setup, pipeline, activity, health, and related operations.
- Slack and Teams approval flows are implemented with authenticated callback handling, duplicate-safe behavior, and workflow dispatch contracts.
- ERP execution is API-primary across QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, and SAP, with browser fallback, rollback controls, and connector-readiness evaluation.
- Workspace and ops APIs expose tenant health, AP KPIs, autopilot status, rollback controls, GA-readiness metadata, and connector readiness.

This tracker is for launch execution, live-environment evidence, and operational proof on top of that implementation baseline.
Do not use `TODOS.md` as a proxy for product completeness.

## Scope and Doctrine Guardrails

This tracker is for launch execution and evidence collection after implementation remediation.
It does not replace the archived implementation trackers.

Non-negotiable product/doctrine guardrails:
- Preserve Solden AP v1 as embedded operational memory for finance work in progress.
- Gmail remains the primary operator surface.
- Slack and Teams remain approval/decision surfaces.
- ERP remains the system of record.
- Preserve browser-agent policy/preview/confirmation/audit semantics.
- Harden operations and prove readiness; do not de-scope agentic behavior into a generic automation platform.
- Any temporary disablement must be via rollout/rollback controls, not code removal.

## Tracker Usage Rules

Statuses:
- `OPEN`
- `IN_PROGRESS`
- `BLOCKED`
- `DONE`
- `WAIVED` (must include approver + rationale + expiration/review date)

`DONE` requires:
- evidence artifact link/path recorded
- validation result recorded
- owner + date updated

Validation command (pilot gate):
```bash
python3 scripts/validate_launch_evidence.py --mode pilot --json
```

## Status Summary Table

| Priority | Total | OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | BLOCKED | DONE | WAIVED |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| P0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 |
| P1 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 0 |
| P2 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| **All** | **16** | **3** | **0** | **0** | **13** | **0** |

The remaining open items are launch-operations tasks, not missing core AP v1 product implementation.

## Immediate Next Actions (recommended)

1. Assign a named human owner for `L08` (manifest) and confirm final pilot scope (tenant + ERP connectors).
2. Run the first staging drill bundle:
   - `L03` scenario subset (posting failure after approval, browser fallback success/failure, restart during retry)
   - `L04` durable retry restart proof
   - `L12` correlation-ID trace walkthrough
3. Record evidence links in the manifest and mark `L01`, `L03`, `L04`, `L12` statuses accordingly.

## Change Log

- `2026-02-25`: Created launch execution tracker seeded from `GA_READINESS_EVIDENCE_PROCESS.md` after archiving completed implementation/remediation trackers.
- `2026-02-25`: Created `docs/ga-evidence/` templates and seeded pilot release scaffold + manifest for `ap-v1-2026-02-25-pilot-rc1`; updated `L08` to `IN_PROGRESS` and `L14` to `DONE`.
- `2026-02-27`: Added a deterministic real-browser Gmail sidebar harness at `ui/gmail-extension/tests/inboxsdk-layer.browser-harness.test.cjs` with script `npm run test:browser-harness`; this strengthens browser-runtime UI wiring confidence while live authenticated Gmail E2E remains tracked under `L01`.
- `2026-02-27`: Extended `ui/gmail-extension/tests/inboxsdk-layer.e2e-smoke.test.cjs` with optional evidence JSON output (`GMAIL_E2E_EVIDENCE_JSON`) so manual Gmail smoke/auth runs produce auditable artifacts for pilot/GA evidence collection.
- `2026-02-27`: Removed non-durable AP post-processing fallback in `solden/services/agent_orchestrator.py` so post-processing is durable-queue-only (or explicitly gated/audited) and updated regression coverage in `tests/test_agent_orchestrator_durable_retry.py`.
- `2026-02-27`: Enforced strict AP-v1 runtime surface pruning in `main.py` (legacy route families are no longer mounted when strict profile is active), with verification in `tests/test_runtime_surface_scope.py`.
- `2026-02-28`: Added authenticated Gmail runtime evidence wrapper + validation pipeline (`npm run test:e2e-auth:evidence`) with normalized report output at `docs/ga-evidence/releases/<release_id>/GMAIL_RUNTIME_E2E.md`; moved `L01` to `IN_PROGRESS` pending live staging run artifact capture.
- `2026-02-28`: Added launch-evidence gate validator script `scripts/validate_launch_evidence.py` and documented the pilot validation command in tracker usage rules.
- `2026-02-28`: Assigned execution owners for pilot-critical evidence items (`L01`, `L02`, `L03`, `L04`, `L11`) to remove `TBD` ownership gaps.
- `2026-02-28`: Populated pilot release evidence working docs (`MANIFEST`, parity/failure/runbook/rollback/signoff files) with automated baseline evidence and moved `L02`, `L03`, `L04`, `L06`, `L07`, `L11` to `IN_PROGRESS`.
- `2026-02-28`: Executed authenticated Gmail runtime evidence command for `L01`; artifacts were produced but run failed due unauthenticated Gmail profile. `L01` moved to `BLOCKED`. Launch evidence validator now reports only `status_not_done` errors for `L01`, `L02`, `L03`, `L04`, `L11` (no missing artifact/link warnings).
- `2026-02-28`: Re-ran `L01` authenticated Gmail runtime evidence with unlocked profile; run passed (`2/2 tests`) and artifacts updated. `L01` returned to `IN_PROGRESS` pending non-Gmail pilot drill evidence (Slack/Teams + ERP + audit chain).
- `2026-02-28`: Ran focused automated evidence bundles for `L02`, `L03`, `L04`, and `L11` (rollback/admin controls `7 passed`, durability restart/dead-letter `4 passed`, failure-mode subset `3 passed`, auth-boundary + Teams verifier subset `12 passed`) and refreshed release evidence files.
- `2026-02-28`: Added `L01` automated AP end-to-end baseline artifact (`docs/ga-evidence/releases/ap-v1-2026-02-25-pilot-rc1/PILOT_E2E_EVIDENCE.md`) with `tests/test_e2e_ap_flow.py` result (`6 passed`).
- `2026-03-02`: Removed `TBD` metadata debt on required GA items (`L05`, `L09`, `L10`, `L12`) by assigning owners and real artifact paths; added canary and observability working docs to keep validator output focused on true status blockers.

## Archive Protocol

When pilot/GA launch execution for the tracked release is complete:
1. Freeze this tracker with final statuses, artifact links, and validation outcomes.
2. Archive to `docs/archive/GA_LAUNCH_READINESS_TRACKER_<release_id>_<date>_<status>.md`.
3. Replace this file with a pointer stub containing archive path and checksum (same pattern as plan trackers).
