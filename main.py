"""
Solden v1 - FastAPI Backend

Solden is the embedded coordination layer for back office operations.
Each workflow instance gets a Box (one persistent home with state
machine + timeline + outcome + exception queue) rendered into
whichever tool the user is already in. Finance is the entry point and
AP is the wedge shipped in v1, but the runtime, intent contract, and
Box primitive are not finance- or AP-specific.

Run Instructions:
-----------------
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements

2. Run the app locally with uvicorn:
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8010 --reload

3. Test /health endpoint:
   curl http://localhost:8010/health

4. Test runtime intent preview endpoint:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/api/agent/intents/preview \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"intent":"read_ap_workflow_health","input":{"limit":25},"organization_id":"default"}'

    Solden API v1 — embedded coordination layer for back office operations.

    **Each workflow instance gets a Box: one persistent home (state machine + append-only timeline + outcome + exception queue) rendered into whichever tool the user is already in.** Finance is the entry point and AP is the wedge in v1; the runtime + intent contract + Box primitive are not finance- or AP-specific.

    ## Agent Runtime
    - Canonical intent contract: `/api/agent/intents/preview` and `/api/agent/intents/execute`
    - Skill-packaged execution (AP skills shipped today; the runtime is workflow-agnostic and expands across back office workflows)
    - Deterministic policy prechecks before execution
    - Idempotency-aware execution and auditable outcomes

    ## AP Workflow (v1 — the wedge)
    - Multi-source invoice intake: Gmail, PEPPOL UBL inbound, ERP-native (NetSuite + SAP S/4HANA)
    - Extraction, 3-way match, ERP vendor master check, budget/tolerance/sanctions guards
    - Approval routing through the customer's actual decision surface (Slack, Teams, NetSuite SuiteApp, SAP Fiori)
    - ERP posting with API-first + controlled fallback patterns: QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, SAP B1, SAP S/4HANA
    - Bank reconciliation (CAMT.053 / OFX), period-close accruals, VAT + reverse-charge, PEPPOL outbound, Africa e-invoice (NG/KE/ZA)

    ## Embedded Surfaces (render targets)
    - Gmail extension — operator work surface (sidebar + label sync)
    - Slack / Teams — approval decision surface
    - NetSuite SuiteApp / SAP Fiori extension — ERP-native operator surfaces
    - Workspace SPA at the configured `APP_BASE_URL` — the agent's home for ops + audit visibility
    
    ## Authentication
    API key authentication is optional. Set `API_KEY` environment variable to enable.
    When enabled, include `X-API-Key` header in requests.
    
    ## Rate Limiting
    Default: 100 requests per 60 seconds per client (IP or API key).
    Configure via `RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS` and `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` environment variables.
