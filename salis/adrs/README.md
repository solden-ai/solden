# Architecture Decision Records

One short doc per decision that would otherwise get re-litigated. Each ADR is a **paragraph of context + the decision + the consequences** so a future engineer can undo the decision if they want — but only after they see the original reasoning.

Format for every ADR:

```
# ADR-NNN: <Title>
Status: Accepted | Superseded-by-ADR-X | Proposed
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Author: <who>

## Context
What was true when the decision was made.

## Decision
What we chose.

## Consequences
What that buys us and what it costs us.

## Alternatives considered
What we explicitly rejected.
```

## When to write a new ADR

Write one when:
- You made a decision that took more than an hour to think through
- The decision could be reasonably reversed (someone might want to reverse it in 6 months)
- The decision has non-obvious tradeoffs

Don't write one for:
- Obvious choices (we use Python; we use Git)
- Taste-level naming
- One-off implementation details with no reusability

Numbering is monotonic. Don't renumber. If an ADR is superseded, write a new one and mark the old one `Superseded-by-ADR-N`.
